Orpheus et Eurydice.
ORPHEUS AND EURYDICE

Veiled in a saffron mantle, through the air<lb/>
unmeasured, after the strange wedding, Hymen<lb/>
departed swiftly for Ciconian land;<lb/>
regardless and not listening to the voice<lb/>
of tuneful Orpheus. Truly Hymen there<lb/>
was present during the festivities<lb/>
of Orpheus and Eurydice, but gave<lb/>
no happy omen, neither hallowed words<lb/>
nor joyful glances; and the torch he held<lb/>
would only sputter, fill the eyes with smoke,<lb/>
and cause no blaze while waving. The result<lb/>
of that sad wedding, proved more terrible<lb/>
than such foreboding fates.<lb/>

    
While through the grass<lb/>
delighted Naiads wandered with the bride,<lb/>
a serpent struck its venomed tooth in her<lb/>
soft ankle— and she died.—After the bard<lb/>
of Rhodope had mourned, and filled the highs<lb/>
of heaven with the moans of his lament,<lb/>
determined also the dark underworld<lb/>
should recognize the misery of death,<lb/>
he dared descend by the Taenarian gate<lb/>
down to the gloomy Styx. And there passed through<lb/>
pale-glimmering phantoms, and the ghosts<lb/>
escaped from sepulchres, until he found<lb/>
Persephone and Pluto, master-king<lb/>
of shadow realms below: and then began<lb/>
to strike his tuneful lyre, to which he sang:—<lb/>

    
“O deities of this dark world beneath<lb/>
the earth! this shadowy underworld, to which<lb/>
all mortals must descend! If it can be<lb/>
called lawful, and if you will suffer speech<lb/>
of strict truth (all the winding ways<lb/>
of Falsity forbidden) I come not<lb/>
down here because of curiosity<lb/>
to see the glooms of Tartarus and have<lb/>
no thought to bind or strangle the three necks<lb/>
of the Medusan Monster, vile with snakes.<lb/>
But I have come, because my darling wife<lb/>
stepped on a viper that sent through her veins<lb/>
death-poison, cutting off her coming years.<lb/>

    
“If able, I would bear it, I do not<lb/>
deny my effort—but the god of Love<lb/>
has conquered me—a god so kindly known<lb/>
in all the upper world. We are not sure<lb/>
he can be known so well in this deep world,<lb/>
but have good reason to conjecture he<lb/>
is not unknown here, and if old report<lb/>
almost forgotten, that you stole your wife<lb/>
is not a fiction, Love united you<lb/>
the same as others. By this Place of Fear<lb/>
this huge void and these vast and silent realms,<lb/>
renew the life-thread of Eurydice.<lb/>

    
“All things are due to you, and though on earth<lb/>
it happens we may tarry a short while,<lb/>
slowly or swiftly we must go to one<lb/>
abode; and it will be our final home.<lb/>
Long and tenaciously you will possess<lb/>
unquestioned mastery of the human race.<lb/>
She also shall be yours to rule, when full<lb/>
of age she shall have lived the days of her<lb/>
allotted years. So I ask of you<lb/>
possession of her few days as a boon.<lb/>
But if the fates deny to me this prayer<lb/>
for my true wife, my constant mind must hold<lb/>
me always so that I can not return—<lb/>
and you may triumph in the death of two!”<lb/>

    
While he sang all his heart said to the sound<lb/>
of his sweet lyre, the bloodless ghosts themselves<lb/>
were weeping, and the anxious Tantalus<lb/>
stopped clutching at return-flow of the wave,<lb/>
Ixion's twisting wheel stood wonder-bound;<lb/>
and Tityus' liver for a while escaped<lb/>
the vultures, and the listening Belides<lb/>
forgot their sieve-like bowls and even you,<lb/>
O Sisyphus! sat idly on your rock!<lb/>

    
Then Fame declared that conquered by the song<lb/>
of Orpheus, for the first and only time<lb/>
the hard cheeks of the fierce Eumenides<lb/>
were wet with tears: nor could the royal queen,<lb/>
nor he who rules the lower world deny<lb/>
the prayer of Orpheus; so they called to them<lb/>
Eurydice, who still was held among<lb/>
the new-arriving shades, and she obeyed<lb/>
the call by walking to them with slow steps,<lb/>
yet halting from her wound. So Orpheus then<lb/>
received his wife; and Pluto told him he<lb/>
might now ascend from these Avernian vales<lb/>
up to the light, with his Eurydice;<lb/>
but, if he turned his eyes to look at her,<lb/>
the gift of her delivery would be lost.<lb/>

    
They picked their way in silence up a steep<lb/>
and gloomy path of darkness. There remained<lb/>
but little more to climb till they would touch<lb/>
earth's surface, when in fear he might again<lb/>
lose her, and anxious for another look<lb/>
at her, he turned his eyes so he could gaze<lb/>
upon her. Instantly she slipped away.<lb/>
He stretched out to her his despairing arms,<lb/>
eager to rescue her, or feel her form,<lb/>
but could hold nothing save the yielding air.<lb/>
Dying the second time, she could not say<lb/>
a word of censure of her husband's fault;<lb/>
what had she to complain of — his great love?<lb/>
Her last word spoken was, “Farewell!” which he<lb/>
could barely hear, and with no further sound<lb/>
she fell from him again to Hades.—Struck<lb/>
quite senseless by this double death of his<lb/>
dear wife, he was as fixed from motion as<lb/>
the frightened one who saw the triple necks<lb/>
of Cerberus, that dog whose middle neck<lb/>
was chained. The sight filled him with terror he<lb/>
had no escape from, until petrified<lb/>
to stone; or like Olenos, changed to stone,<lb/>
because he fastened on himself the guilt<lb/>
of his wife. O unfortunate Lethaea!<lb/>
Too boastful of your beauty, you and he,<lb/>
united once in love, are now two stones<lb/>
upon the mountain Ida, moist with springs.<lb/>

    
Orpheus implored in vain the ferryman<lb/>
to help him cross the River Styx again,<lb/>
but was denied the very hope of death.<lb/>
Seven days he sat upon Death's river bank,<lb/>
in squalid misery and without all food—<lb/>
nourished by grief, anxiety, and tears—<lb/>
complaining that the Gods of Erebus<lb/>
were pitiless, at last he wandered back,<lb/>
until he came to lofty Rhodope<lb/>
and Haemus, beaten by the strong north wind.<lb/>

    
Three times the Sun completed his full course<lb/>
to watery Pisces, and in all that time,<lb/>
shunning all women, Orpheus still believed<lb/>
his love-pledge was forever. So he kept<lb/>
away from women, though so many grieved,<lb/>
because he took no notice of their love.<lb/>
The only friendship he enjoyed was given<lb/>
to the young men of Thrace.<lb/>


Arbores motae. Cyparissus.
ATTIS

There was a hill<lb/>
which rose up to a level plateau, high<lb/>
and beautiful with green grass; and there was<lb/>
not any shade for comfort on the top<lb/>
and there on that luxuriant grass the bard,<lb/>
while heaven-inspired reclined, and struck<lb/>
such harmonies on his sweet lyre that shade<lb/>
most grateful to the hill was spread around.<lb/>
Strong trees came up there—the Chaonian oak<lb/>
the Heliads' poplar, and the lofty-branched<lb/>
deep mast-tree, the soft linden and the beech,<lb/>
the brittle hazel, and the virgin laurel-tree,<lb/>
the ash for strong spears, the smooth silver-fir,<lb/>
the flex bent with acorns and the plane,<lb/>
the various tinted maple and with those,<lb/>
the lotus and green willows from their streams,<lb/>
evergreen box and slender tamarisks,<lb/>
rich myrtles of two colors and the tine,<lb/>
bending with green-blue berries: and you, too,<lb/>
the pliant-footed ivy, came along<lb/>
with tendril-branching grape-vines, and the elm<lb/>
all covered with twist-vines, the mountain-ash,<lb/>
pitch-trees and arbute-trees of blushing fruit,<lb/>
the bending-palm prized after victories,<lb/>
the bare-trunk pine of tufted foliage,<lb/>
bristled upon the top, a pleasant sight<lb/>
delightful to the Mother of the Gods;<lb/>
since Attis dear to Cybele, exchanged<lb/>
his human form which hardened in that tree.<lb/>

CYPARISSUS

In all the throng the cone-shaped cypress came;<lb/>
a tree now, it was changed from a dear youth<lb/>
loved by the god who strings the lyre and bow.<lb/>
For there was at one time, a mighty stag<lb/>
held sacred by those nymphs who haunt the fields<lb/>
Carthaean. His great antlers spread so wide,<lb/>
they gave an ample shade to his own head.<lb/>
Those antlers shone with gold: from his smooth throat<lb/>
a necklace, studded with a wealth of gems,<lb/>
hung down to his strong shoulders—beautiful.<lb/>
A silver boss, fastened with little thongs,<lb/>
played on his forehead, worn there from his birth;<lb/>
and pendants from both ears, of gleaming pearls,<lb/>
adorned his hollow temples. Free of fear,<lb/>
and now no longer shy, frequenting homes<lb/>
of men he knew, he offered his soft neck<lb/>
even to strangers for their petting hands.<lb/>

    
But more than by all others, he was loved<lb/>
by you, O Cyparissus, fairest youth<lb/>
of all the lads of Cea. It was you<lb/>
who led the pet stag to fresh pasturage,<lb/>
and to the waters of the clearest spring.<lb/>
Sometimes you wove bright garlands for his horns,<lb/>
and sometimes, like a horseman on his back,<lb/>
now here now there, you guided his soft mouth<lb/>
with purple reins. It was upon a summer day,<lb/>
at high noon when the Crab, of spreading claws,<lb/>
loving the sea-shore, almost burnt beneath<lb/>
the sun's hot burning rays; and the pet stag<lb/>
was then reclining on the grassy earth<lb/>
and, wearied of all action, found relief<lb/>
under the cool shade of the forest trees;<lb/>
that as he lay there Cyparissus pierced<lb/>
him with a javelin: and although it was<lb/>
quite accidental, when the shocked youth saw<lb/>
his loved stag dying from the cruel wound<lb/>
he could not bear it, and resolved on death.<lb/>
What did not Phoebus say to comfort him?<lb/>
He cautioned him to hold his grief in check,<lb/>
consistent with the cause. But still the lad<lb/>
lamented, and with groans implored the Gods<lb/>
that he might mourn forever. His life force<lb/>
exhausted by long weeping, now his limbs<lb/>
began to take a green tint, and his hair,<lb/>
which overhung his snow-white brow, turned up<lb/>
into a bristling crest; and he became<lb/>
a stiff tree with a slender top and pointed<lb/>
up to the starry heavens. And the God,<lb/>
groaning with sorrow, said; “You shall be mourned<lb/>
sincerely by me, surely as you mourn<lb/>
for others, and forever you shall stand<lb/>
in grief, where others grieve.”<lb/>


Ganymedes. Hyacinthus.

Such was the grove<lb/>
by Orpheus drawn together; and he sat<lb/>
surrounded by assembled animals,<lb/>
and many strange Birds. When he tried the chords<lb/>
by touching with his thumb, and was convinced<lb/>
the notes were all in harmony, although<lb/>
attuned to various melody, he raised<lb/>
his voice and sang:<lb/>

    
“Oh my loved mother, Muse,<lb/>
from Jove inspire my song—for all things yield,<lb/>
to the unequalled sway of Jove—oh, I<lb/>
have sung so often Jupiter's great power<lb/>
before this day, and in a wilder strain,<lb/>
I've sung the giants and victorious bolts<lb/>
hurled on Phlegraean plains. But now I need<lb/>
the gentler touch; for I would sing of boys,<lb/>
the favorites of Gods, and even of maids<lb/>
who had to pay the penalty of wrong.”<lb/>

GANYMEDE

The king of all the Gods once burned with love<lb/>
for Ganymede of Phrygia. He found<lb/>
a shape more pleasing even than his own.<lb/>
Jove would not take the form of any bird,<lb/>
except the eagle's, able to sustain<lb/>
the weight of his own thunderbolts. Without<lb/>
delay, Jove on fictitious eagle wings,<lb/>
stole and flew off with that loved Trojan boy:<lb/>
who even to this day, against the will<lb/>
of Juno, mingles nectar in the cups<lb/>
of his protector, mighty Jupiter.<lb/>

HYACINTHUS

You also, Hyacinthus, would have been<lb/>
set in the sky! if Phoebus had been given<lb/>
time which the cruel fates denied for you.<lb/>
But in a way you are immortal too.<lb/>
Though you have died. Always when warm spring<lb/>
drives winter out, and Aries (the Ram)<lb/>
succeeds to Pisces (watery Fish), you rise<lb/>
and blossom on the green turf. And the love<lb/>
my father had for you was deeper than he felt<lb/>
for others. Delphi center of the world,<lb/>
had no presiding guardian, while the God<lb/>
frequented the Eurotas and the land<lb/>
of Sparta, never fortified with walls.<lb/>
His zither and his bow no longer fill<lb/>
his eager mind and now without a thought<lb/>
of dignity, he carried nets and held<lb/>
the dogs in leash, and did not hesitate<lb/>
to go with Hyacinthus on the rough,<lb/>
steep mountain ridges; and by all of such<lb/>
associations, his love was increased.<lb/>

    
Now Titan was about midway, betwixt<lb/>
the coming and the banished night, and stood<lb/>
at equal distance from those two extremes.<lb/>
Then, when the youth and Phoebus were well stripped,<lb/>
and gleaming with rich olive oil, they tried<lb/>
a friendly contest with the discus. First<lb/>
Phoebus, well-poised, sent it awhirl through air,<lb/>
and cleft the clouds beyond with its broad weight;<lb/>
from which at length it fell down to the earth,<lb/>
a certain evidence of strength and skill.<lb/>
Heedless of danger Hyacinthus rushed<lb/>
for eager glory of the game, resolved<lb/>
to get the discus. But it bounded back<lb/>
from off the hard earth, and struck full against<lb/>
your face, O Hyacinthus! Deadly pale<lb/>
the God's face went — as pallid as the boy's.<lb/>
With care he lifted the sad huddled form.<lb/>

    
The kind god tries to warm you back to life,<lb/>
and next endeavors to attend your wound,<lb/>
and stay your parting soul with healing herbs.<lb/>
His skill is no advantage, for the wound<lb/>
is past all art of cure. As if someone,<lb/>
when in a garden, breaks off violets,<lb/>
poppies, or lilies hung from golden stems,<lb/>
then drooping they must hang their withered heads,<lb/>
and gaze down towards the earth beneath them; so,<lb/>
the dying boy's face droops, and his bent neck,<lb/>
a burden to itself, falls back upon<lb/>
his shoulder: “You are fallen in your prime<lb/>
defrauded of your youth, O Hyacinthus!”<lb/>
Moaned Apollo. “I can see in your sad wound<lb/>
my own guilt, and you are my cause of grief<lb/>
and self-reproach. My own hand gave you death<lb/>
unmerited — I only can be charged<lb/>
with your destruction.—What have I done wrong?<lb/>
Can it be called a fault to play with you?<lb/>
Should loving you be called a fault? And oh,<lb/>
that I might now give up my life for you!<lb/>
Or die with you! But since our destinies<lb/>
prevent us you shall always be with me,<lb/>
and you shall dwell upon my care-filled lips.<lb/>
The lyre struck by my hand, and my true songs<lb/>
will always celebrate you. A new flower<lb/>
you shall arise, with markings on your petals,<lb/>
close imitation of my constant moans:<lb/>
and there shall come another to be linked<lb/>
with this new flower, a valiant hero shall<lb/>
be known by the same marks upon its petals.”<lb/>

    
And while Phoebus, Apollo, sang these words<lb/>
with his truth-telling lips, behold the blood<lb/>
of Hyacinthus, which had poured out on<lb/>
the ground beside him and there stained the grass,<lb/>
was changed from blood; and in its place a flower,<lb/>
more beautiful than Tyrian dye, sprang up.<lb/>
It almost seemed a lily, were it not<lb/>
that one was purple and the other white.<lb/>

    
But Phoebus was not satisfied with this.<lb/>
For it was he who worked the miracle<lb/>
of his sad words inscribed on flower leaves.<lb/>
These letters AI, AI, are inscribed<lb/>
on them. And Sparta certainly is proud<lb/>
to honor Hyacinthus as her son;<lb/>
and his loved fame endures; and every year<lb/>
they celebrate his solemn festival.<lb/>


Cerastae et Propoetides.
THE CERASTAE AND PROPOETIDES

If you should ask Amathus, which is rich<lb/>
in metals, how can she rejoice and take<lb/>
a pride in deeds of her Propoetides;<lb/>
she would disclaim it and repudiate<lb/>
them all, as well as those of transformed men,<lb/>
whose foreheads were deformed by two rough horns,<lb/>
from which their name Cerastae. By their gates<lb/>
an altar unto Jove stood. If by chance<lb/>
a stranger, not informed of their dark crimes,<lb/>
had seen the horrid altar smeared with blood,<lb/>
he would suppose that suckling calves and sheep<lb/>
of Amathus, were sacrificed thereon—<lb/>
it was in fact the blood of slaughtered guests!<lb/>

    
Kind-hearted Venus, outraged by such deeds<lb/>
of sacrifice, was ready to desert<lb/>
her cities and her snake-infested plains;<lb/>
“But how,” said she, “have their delightful lands<lb/>
together with my well built cities sinned?<lb/>
What crime have they done?—Those inhabitants<lb/>
should pay the penalty of their own crimes<lb/>
by exile or by death; or it may be<lb/>
a middle course, between exile and death;<lb/>
and what can that be, but the punishment<lb/>
of a changed form?” And while she hesitates,<lb/>
in various thoughts of what form they should take,<lb/>
her eyes by chance, observed their horns,<lb/>
and that decided her; such horns could well<lb/>
be on them after any change occurred,<lb/>
and she transformed their big and brutal bodies<lb/>
to savage bulls.<lb/>

    
But even after that,<lb/>
the obscene Propoetides dared to deny<lb/>
divinity of Venus, for which fault,<lb/>
(and it is common fame) they were the first<lb/>
to criminate their bodies, through the wrath<lb/>
of Venus; and so blushing shame was lost,<lb/>
white blood, in their bad faces grew so fast,<lb/>
so hard, it was no wonder they were turned<lb/>
with small change into hard and lifeless stones.<lb/>


Pygmalion.
PYGMALION AND THE STATUE

Pygmalion saw these women waste their lives<lb/>
in wretched shame, and critical of faults<lb/>
which nature had so deeply planted through<lb/>
their female hearts, he lived in preference,<lb/>
for many years unmarried.—But while he<lb/>
was single, with consummate skill, he carved<lb/>
a statue out of snow-white ivory,<lb/>
and gave to it exquisite beauty, which<lb/>
no woman of the world has ever equalled:<lb/>
she was so beautiful, he fell in love<lb/>
with his creation. It appeared in truth<lb/>
a perfect virgin with the grace of life,<lb/>
but in the expression of such modesty<lb/>
all motion was restrained—and so his art<lb/>
concealed his art. Pygmalion gazed, inflamed<lb/>
with love and admiration for the form,<lb/>
in semblance of a woman, he had carved.<lb/>

    
He lifts up both his hands to feel the work,<lb/>
and wonders if it can be ivory,<lb/>
because it seems to him more truly flesh. —<lb/>
his mind refusing to conceive of it<lb/>
as ivory, he kisses it and feels<lb/>
his kisses are returned. And speaking love,<lb/>
caresses it with loving hands that seem<lb/>
to make an impress, on the parts they touch,<lb/>
so real that he fears he then may bruise<lb/>
her by his eager pressing. Softest tones<lb/>
are used each time he speaks to her. He brings<lb/>
to her such presents as are surely prized<lb/>
by sweet girls; such as smooth round pebbles, shells,<lb/>
and birds, and fragrant flowers of thousand tints,<lb/>
lilies, and painted balls, and amber tears<lb/>
of Heliads, which distill from far off trees.—<lb/>
he drapes her in rich clothing and in gems:<lb/>
rings on her fingers, a rich necklace round<lb/>
her neck, pearl pendants on her graceful ears;<lb/>
and golden ornaments adorn her breast.<lb/>
All these are beautiful—and she appears<lb/>
most lovable, if carefully attired,—<lb/>
or perfect as a statue, unadorned.<lb/>

    
He lays her on a bed luxurious, spread<lb/>
with coverlets of Tyrian purple dye,<lb/>
and naming her the consort of his couch,<lb/>
lays her reclining head on the most soft<lb/>
and downy pillows, trusting she could feel.<lb/>

    
The festal day of Venus, known throughout<lb/>
all Cyprus, now had come, and throngs were there<lb/>
to celebrate. Heifers with spreading horns,<lb/>
all gold-tipped, fell when given the stroke of death<lb/>
upon their snow-white necks; and frankincense<lb/>
was smoking on the altars. There, intent,<lb/>
Pygmalion stood before an altar, when<lb/>
his offering had been made; and although he<lb/>
feared the result, he prayed: “If it is true,<lb/>
O Gods, that you can give all things, I pray<lb/>
to have as my wife—” but, he did not dare<lb/>
to add “my ivory statue-maid,” and said,<lb/>
“One like my ivory—.” Golden Venus heard,<lb/>
for she was present at her festival,<lb/>
and she knew clearly what the prayer had meant.<lb/>
She gave a sign that her Divinity<lb/>
favored his plea: three times the flame leaped high<lb/>
and brightly in the air.<lb/>

    
When he returned,<lb/>
he went directly to his image-maid,<lb/>
bent over her, and kissed her many times,<lb/>
while she was on her couch; and as he kissed,<lb/>
she seemed to gather some warmth from his lips.<lb/>
Again he kissed her; and he felt her breast;<lb/>
the ivory seemed to soften at the touch,<lb/>
and its firm texture yielded to his hand,<lb/>
as honey-wax of Mount Hymettus turns<lb/>
to many shapes when handled in the sun,<lb/>
and surely softens from each gentle touch.<lb/>

    
He is amazed; but stands rejoicing in his doubt;<lb/>
while fearful there is some mistake, again<lb/>
and yet again, gives trial to his hopes<lb/>
by touching with his hand. It must be flesh!<lb/>
The veins pulsate beneath the careful test<lb/>
of his directed finger. Then, indeed,<lb/>
the astonished hero poured out lavish thanks<lb/>
to Venus; pressing with his raptured lips<lb/>
his statue's lips. Now real, true to life—<lb/>
the maiden felt the kisses given to her,<lb/>
and blushing, lifted up her timid eyes,<lb/>
so that she saw the light and sky above,<lb/>
as well as her rapt lover while he leaned<lb/>
gazing beside her—and all this at once—<lb/>
the goddess graced the marriage she had willed,<lb/>
and when nine times a crescent moon had changed,<lb/>
increasing to the full, the statue-bride<lb/>
gave birth to her dear daughter Paphos. From<lb/>
which famed event the island takes its name.<lb/>


Myrrha.
MYRRHA TRANSFORMED TO A TREE

The royal Cinyras was sprung from her;<lb/>
and if he had been father of no child,<lb/>
might well have been accounted fortunate—<lb/>
but I must sing of horrible events—<lb/>
avoid it daughters! Parents! shun this tale!<lb/>
But if my verse has charmed your thought,<lb/>
do not give me such credit in this part;<lb/>
convince yourself it cannot be true life;<lb/>
or, if against my wish you hear and must<lb/>
believe it, then be sure to notice how<lb/>
such wickedness gets certain punishment.<lb/>

    
And yet, if Nature could permit such crimes<lb/>
as this to happen, I congratulate<lb/>
Ismarian people and all Thrace as well,<lb/>
and I congratulate this nation, which<lb/>
we know is far away from the land where<lb/>
this vile abomination did occur.<lb/>

    
The land we call Panchaia may be rich<lb/>
in balsam, cinnamon, and costum sweet<lb/>
for ointment, frankincense distilled from trees,<lb/>
with many flowers besides. All this large wealth<lb/>
combined could never compensate the land<lb/>
for this detestable, one crime: even though<lb/>
the new Myrrh-Tree advanced on that rich soil.<lb/>

    
Cupid declares his weapons never caused<lb/>
an injury to Myrrha, and denies<lb/>
his torches ever could have urged her crime.—<lb/>
one of the three bad sisters kindled this,<lb/>
with fire brand from the Styx, and poisoned you<lb/>
with swollen vipers.—It is criminal<lb/>
to hate a parent, but love such as hers<lb/>
is certainly more criminal than hate.<lb/>

    
The chosen princes of all lands desire<lb/>
you now in marriage, and young men throughout<lb/>
the Orient are vying for your hand.<lb/>
Choose, Myrrha one from all of these for your<lb/>
good husband; but exclude from such a thought<lb/>
your father only. She indeed is quite<lb/>
aware, and struggles bitterly against<lb/>
her vile desires, and argues in her heart:—<lb/>

    
“What am I tending to? O listening Gods<lb/>
I pray for aid, I pray to Natural Love!<lb/>
Ah, may the sacred rights of parents keep<lb/>
this vile desire from me, defend me from<lb/>
a crime so great—If it indeed is crime.<lb/>
I am not sure it is—I have not heard<lb/>
that any god or written law condemns<lb/>
the union of a parent and his child.<lb/>
All animals will mate as they desire—<lb/>
a heifer may endure her sire, and who<lb/>
condemns it? And the happy stud is not<lb/>
refused by his mare-daughters: the he-goat<lb/>
consorts unthought-of with the flock of which<lb/>
he is the father; and the birds conceive<lb/>
of those from whom they were themselves begot.<lb/>
Happy are they who have such privilege!<lb/>
Malignant men have given spiteful laws;<lb/>
and what is right to Nature is decreed<lb/>
unnatural, by jealous laws of men.<lb/>

    
“But it is said there are some tribes today,<lb/>
in which the mother marries her own son;<lb/>
the daughter takes her father; and by this,<lb/>
the love kind Nature gives them is increased<lb/>
into a double bond.—Ah wretched me!<lb/>
Why was it not my fortune to be born<lb/>
in that love-blessed land? I must abide,<lb/>
depressed by my misfortunes, in this place.<lb/>

    
“Why do I dwell on these forbidden hopes?<lb/>
Let me forget to think of lawless flame.<lb/>
My father is most worthy of my love,<lb/>
but only as a father.—If I were<lb/>
not born the daughter of great Cinyras,<lb/>
I might be joined to him; but, as it stands,<lb/>
because he is mine he is never mine;<lb/>
because near to me he is far from me.<lb/>

    
“It would be better for me, if we were<lb/>
but strangers to each other; for I then,<lb/>
could wish to go, and leave my native land,<lb/>
and so escape temptation to this crime:<lb/>
but my unhappy passion holds me here,<lb/>
that I may see Cinyras face to face,<lb/>
and touch him, talk with him and even kiss him—<lb/>
the best, if nothing else can be allowed.<lb/>

    
“But what more could be asked for, by the most<lb/>
depraved? Think of the many sacred ties<lb/>
and loved names, you are dragging to the mire:<lb/>
the rival of your mother, will you be<lb/>
the mistress of your father, and be named<lb/>
the sister of your son, and make yourself<lb/>
the mother of your brother? And will you<lb/>
not dread the sisters with black snakes for hair.<lb/>
Whom guilty creatures, such as you, can see<lb/>
brandish relentless flames before their eyes<lb/>
and faces? While your body has not sinned<lb/>
you must not let sin creep into your heart,<lb/>
and violate great Nature's law with your<lb/>
unlawful rovings. If you had the right<lb/>
to long for his endearment, it could not<lb/>
be possible. He is a virtuous man<lb/>
and is regardful of the moral law—<lb/>
oh how I wish my passion could be his!”<lb/>

    
And so she argued and declared her love:<lb/>
but Cinyras, her father, who was urged<lb/>
by such a throng of suitors for her hand,<lb/>
that he could make no choice, at last inquired<lb/>
of her, so she might make her heart's wish known.<lb/>
And as he named them over, asked her which<lb/>
she fixed her gaze upon her father's face,<lb/>
in doubtful agony what she could say,<lb/>
while hot tears filled her eyes. Her father, sure<lb/>
it all was of a virginal alarm,<lb/>
as he is telling her she need not weep<lb/>
dries her wet cheeks and kisses her sweet lips.<lb/>
Too much delighted with his gentle words<lb/>
and kind endearments, Myrrha, when he asked<lb/>
again, which one might be her husband, said,<lb/>
“The one just like yourself.”, And he replied<lb/>
not understanding what her heart would say,<lb/>
“You answer as a loving-daughter should.”<lb/>
When she heard “loving-daughter” said, the girl<lb/>
too conscious of her guilt, looked on the ground.<lb/>

    
It was now midnight, peaceful sleep dissolved<lb/>
the world-care of all mortals, but of her<lb/>
who, sleepless through the night, burnt in the flame<lb/>
of her misplaced affection. First despair<lb/>
compels her to abandon every hope,<lb/>
and then she changes and resolves to try;<lb/>
and so she wavers from desire to shame,<lb/>
for she could not adhere to any plan.<lb/>

    
As a great tree, cut by the swinging axe<lb/>
is chopped until the last blow has been struck,<lb/>
then sways and threatens danger to all sides;<lb/>
so does her weak mind, cut with many blows,<lb/>
waver unsteadily—this way and that—<lb/>
and turning back and forth it finds no rest<lb/>
from passion, save the rest that lies in death.<lb/>

    
The thought of death gave comfort to her heart.<lb/>
Resolved to hang herself, she sat upright;<lb/>
then, as she tied her girdle to a beam,<lb/>
she said, “Farewell, beloved Cinyras,<lb/>
and may you know the cause of my sad death.”<lb/>
And while she spoke those words, her fingers fixed<lb/>
the noosed rope close around her death-pale neck.<lb/>

    
They say the murmur of despairing words<lb/>
was heard by her attentive nurse who watched<lb/>
outside the room. And, faithful as of old,<lb/>
she opened the shut door. But, when she saw<lb/>
the frightful preparations made for death,<lb/>
the odd nurse screamed and beat and tore her breast,<lb/>
then seized and snatched the rope from Myrrha's neck;<lb/>
and after she had torn the noose apart,<lb/>
at last she had the time to weep and time,<lb/>
while she embraced the girl, to ask her why<lb/>
the halter had been fastened round her neck.<lb/>
The girl in stubborn silence only fixed<lb/>
her eyes upon the ground—sad that her first<lb/>
attempt at death, because too slow, was foiled.<lb/>
The old nurse-woman urged and urged, and showed<lb/>
her gray hair and her withered breasts, and begged<lb/>
her by the memory of her cradle days,<lb/>
and baby nourishment, to hide no more<lb/>
from her long-trusted nurse what caused her grief.<lb/>
The girl turned from her questions with a sigh.<lb/>
The nurse, still more determined to know all,<lb/>
promised fidelity and her best aid—<lb/>

    
“Tell me,” she said, “and let me give you help;<lb/>
my old age offers means for your relief:<lb/>
if it be frantic passion, I have charms<lb/>
and healing herbs; or, if an evil spell<lb/>
was worked on you by someone, you shall be<lb/>
cured to your perfect self by magic rites;<lb/>
or, if your actions have enraged the Gods,<lb/>
a sacrifice will satisfy their wrath.<lb/>
What else could be the cause? Your family<lb/>
and you are prosperous—your mother dear,<lb/>
and your loved father are alive and well.”<lb/>
And, when she heard her say the name of father,<lb/>
a sigh heaved up from her distracted heart.<lb/>

    
But even after that the nurse could not<lb/>
conceive such evil in the girl's sick heart;<lb/>
and yet she had a feeling it must be<lb/>
only a love affair could cause the crime:<lb/>
and with persistent purpose begged the cause.<lb/>
She pressed the weeping girl against her breast;<lb/>
and as she held her in her feeble arms,<lb/>
she said, “Sweet heart, I know you are in love:<lb/>
in this affair I am entirely yours<lb/>
for your good service, you must have no fear,<lb/>
your father cannot learn of it from me.,”<lb/>

    
just like a mad girl, Myrrha sprang away,<lb/>
and with her face deep-buried in a couch,<lb/>
sobbed out, “Go from me or stop asking me<lb/>
my cause of grief—it is a crime of shame—<lb/>
I cannot tell it!” Horrified the nurse<lb/>
stretched forth her trembling hands, palsied<lb/>
with age and fear. She fell down at the feet<lb/>
of her loved foster-child, and coaxing her<lb/>
and frightening her, she threatened to disclose<lb/>
her knowledge of the halter and of what<lb/>
she knew of her attempted suicide;<lb/>
and after all was said, she gave her word<lb/>
to help the girl, when she had given to her<lb/>
a true confession of her sad heart-love.<lb/>

    
The girl just lifted up her face, and laid<lb/>
it, weeping, on the bosom of her nurse.<lb/>
She tried so often to confess, and just<lb/>
as often checked her words, her shamed face hid<lb/>
deep in her garment: “Oh”, at last she groans,<lb/>
“O mother blessed in your husband—oh!”<lb/>
Only that much she said and groaned. The nurse<lb/>
felt a cold horror stealing through her heart<lb/>
and frame, for she now understood it all.<lb/>
And her white hair stood bristling on her head,<lb/>
while with the utmost care of love and art<lb/>
she strove to use appropriate words and deeds,<lb/>
to banish the mad passion of the girl.<lb/>
Though Myrrha knew that she was truly warned,<lb/>
she was resolved to die, unless she could<lb/>
obtain the object of her wicked love.<lb/>
The nurse gave way at last as in defeat,<lb/>
and said, “Live and enjoy—” but did not dare<lb/>
to say, “your father”, did not finish, though,<lb/>
she promised and confirmed it with an oath.<lb/>

    
It was the time when matrons celebrate<lb/>
the annual festival of Ceres. Then,<lb/>
all robed in decent garments of snow-white,<lb/>
they bring garlands of precious wheat, which are<lb/>
first fruits of worship; and for nine nights they<lb/>
must count forbidden every act of love,<lb/>
and shun the touch of man. And in that throng,<lb/>
Cenchreis, the king's wife, with constant care<lb/>
attended every secret rite: and so<lb/>
while the king's bed was lacking his true wife,<lb/>
one of those nights,—King Cinyras was drunk<lb/>
with too much wine,—the scheming nurse informed<lb/>
him of a girl most beautiful, whose love<lb/>
for him was passionate; in a false tale<lb/>
she pictured a true passion. — When he asked<lb/>
the maiden's age, she answered, “Just the same<lb/>
as Myrrha's.” Bidden by the king to go<lb/>
and fetch her, the officious old nurse, when<lb/>
she found the girl, cried out; “Rejoice, my dear,<lb/>
we have contrived it!” The unhappy girl<lb/>
could not feel genuine joy in her amazed<lb/>
and startled body. Her dazed mind was filled<lb/>
with strange forebodings; but she did believe<lb/>
her heart was joyful.—Great excitement filled<lb/>
her wrecked heart with such inconsistencies.<lb/>

    
Now was the time when nature is at rest;<lb/>
between the Bears, Bootes turned his wain<lb/>
down to the west, and the guilty Myrrha turns<lb/>
to her enormity. The golden moon<lb/>
flies from the heaven, and black clouds cover<lb/>
the hiding stars and Night has lost her fires.<lb/>
The first to hide were stars of Icarus<lb/>
and of Erigone, in hallowed love<lb/>
devoted to her father. Myrrha thrice<lb/>
was warned by omen of her stumbling foot;<lb/>
the funeral screech-owl also warned her thrice,<lb/>
with dismal cry; yet Myrrha onward goes.<lb/>
It seems to her the black night lessens shame.<lb/>
She holds fast to her nurse with her left hand,<lb/>
and with the other hand gropes through the dark.<lb/>
And now they go until she finds the door.<lb/>
Now at the threshold of her father's room,<lb/>
she softly pushes back the door, her nurse<lb/>
takes her within. The girl's knees trembling sink<lb/>
beneath her. Her drawn bloodless face has lost<lb/>
its color, and while she moves to the crime,<lb/>
bad courage goes from her until afraid<lb/>
of her bold effort, she would gladly turn<lb/>
unrecognized. But as she hesitates,<lb/>
the aged crone still holds her by the hand;<lb/>
and leading her up to the high bed there<lb/>
delivering Myrrha, says, “Now Cinyras,<lb/>
you take her, she is yours;” and leaves the pair<lb/>
doomed in their crime — the father to pollute<lb/>
his own flesh in his own bed; where he tries<lb/>
first to encourage her from maiden fears,<lb/>
by gently talking to the timid girl.<lb/>
He chanced to call her “daughter,” as a name<lb/>
best suited to her age; and she in turn,<lb/>
endearing, called him “father”, so no names<lb/>
might be omitted to complete their guilt.<lb/>

    
She staggered from his chamber with the crime<lb/>
of her own father hidden in her womb,<lb/>
and their guilt was repeated many nights;<lb/>
till Cinyras — determined he must know<lb/>
his mistress, after many meetings, brought<lb/>
a light and knew his crime had harmed his daughter.<lb/>

    
Speechless in shame he drew forth his bright sword<lb/>
out from the scabbard where it hung near by.—<lb/>
but frightened Myrrha fled, and so escaped<lb/>
death in the shadows of dark night. Groping<lb/>
her pathless way at random through the fields,<lb/>
she left Arabia, famed for spreading palms,<lb/>
and wandered through Panchaean lands. Until<lb/>
after nine months of aimless wandering days,<lb/>
she rested in Sabaea, for she could<lb/>
not hold the burden she had borne so long.<lb/>

    
Not knowing what to pray for, moved alike<lb/>
by fear of death and weariness of life,<lb/>
her wishes were expressed in prayer: “O Gods,<lb/>
if you will listen to my prayer, I do<lb/>
not shun a dreadful punishment deserved;<lb/>
but now because my life offends the living,<lb/>
and dying I offend the dead, drive me<lb/>
from both conditions; change me, and refuse<lb/>
my flesh both life and death!”<lb/>

    
Some god did listen<lb/>
to her unnatural prayer; her last petition<lb/>
had answering gods. For even as she prayed,<lb/>
the earth closed over her legs; roots grew out<lb/>
and, stretching forth obliquely from her nails,<lb/>
gave strong support to her up-growing trunk;<lb/>
her bones got harder, and her marrow still<lb/>
unchanged, kept to the center, as her blood<lb/>
was changed to sap, as her outstretching arms<lb/>
became long branches and her fingers twigs;<lb/>
and as her soft skin hardened into bark:<lb/>
and the fast-growing tree had closely bound<lb/>
her womb, still heavy, and had covered her<lb/>
soft bosom; and was spreading quickly up<lb/>
to her neck.—She can not endure the strain,<lb/>
and sinking down into the rising wood,<lb/>
her whole face soon was hidden in the bark.<lb/>
Although all sense of human life was gone,<lb/>
as quickly as she lost her human form,<lb/>
her weeping was continued, and warm drops<lb/>
distilled from her (the tree) cease not to fall.<lb/>
There is a virtue even in her tears—<lb/>
the valued myrrh distilling from the trunk,<lb/>
keeps to her name, by which she still is known,<lb/>
and cannot be forgot of aging time.<lb/>

    
The guilt-begotten child had growth while wood<lb/>
was growing, and endeavored now to find<lb/>
a way of safe birth. The tree-trunk was swelling<lb/>
and tightened against Myrrha, who, unable<lb/>
to express her torture, could not call upon<lb/>
Lucina in the usual words of travail.<lb/>
But then just like a woman in great pain,<lb/>
the tree bends down and, while it groans, bedews<lb/>
itself with falling tears. Lucina stood<lb/>
in pity near the groaning branches, laid<lb/>
her hands on them, and uttered charms to aid<lb/>
the hindered birth. The tree cracked open then,<lb/>
the bark was rent asunder, and it gave forth<lb/>
its living weight, a wailing baby-boy.<lb/>
The Naiads laid him on soft leaves, and they<lb/>
anointed him with his own mother's tears.<lb/>

    
Even Envy would not fail to praise the child,<lb/>
as beautiful as naked cupids seen<lb/>
in chosen paintings. Only give to him<lb/>
a polished quiver, or take theirs from them,<lb/>
and no keen eye could choose him from their midst.<lb/>


Venus et Adonis. Atalanta.

Time gliding by without our knowledge cheats us,<lb/>
and nothing can be swifter than the years.<lb/>
That son of sister and grandfather, who<lb/>
was lately hidden in his parent tree,<lb/>
just lately born, a lovely baby-boy<lb/>
is now a youth, now man more beautiful<lb/>
than during growth. He wins the love of Venus<lb/>
and so avenges his own mother's passion.<lb/>
For while the goddess' son with quiver held<lb/>
on shoulder, once was kissing his loved mother,<lb/>
it chanced unwittingly he grazed her breast<lb/>
with a projecting arrow. Instantly<lb/>
the wounded goddess pushed her son away;<lb/>
but the scratch had pierced her deeper than she thought<lb/>
and even Venus was at first deceived.<lb/>

    
Delighted with the beauty of the youth,<lb/>
she does not think of her Cytherian shores<lb/>
and does not care for Paphos, which is girt<lb/>
by the deep sea, nor Cnidos, haunts of fish,<lb/>
nor Amathus far-famed for precious ores.<lb/>

    
Venus, neglecting heaven, prefers Adonis<lb/>
to heaven, and so she holds close to his ways<lb/>
as his companion, and forgets to rest<lb/>
at noon-day in the shade, neglecting care<lb/>
of her sweet beauty. She goes through the woods,<lb/>
and over mountain ridges and wild fields,<lb/>
rocky and thorn-set, bare to her white knees<lb/>
after Diana's manner. And she cheers<lb/>
the hounds, intent to hunt for harmless prey,<lb/>
such as the leaping hare, or the wild stag,<lb/>
high-crowned with branching antlers, or the doe.—<lb/>
she keeps away from fierce wild boars, away<lb/>
from ravenous wolves; and she avoids the bears<lb/>
of frightful claws, and lions glutted with<lb/>
the blood of slaughtered cattle.<lb/>

    
She warns you,<lb/>
Adonis, to beware and fear them. If her fears<lb/>
for you were only heeded! “Oh be brave,”<lb/>
she says, “against those timid animals<lb/>
which fly from you; but courage is not safe<lb/>
against the bold. Dear boy, do not be rash,<lb/>
do not attack the wild beasts which are armed<lb/>
by nature, lest your glory may cost me<lb/>
great sorrow. Neither youth nor beauty nor<lb/>
the deeds which have moved Venus have effect<lb/>
on lions, bristling boars, and on the eyes<lb/>
and tempers of wild beasts. Boars have the force<lb/>
of lightning in their curved tusks, and the rage<lb/>
of tawny lions is unlimited.<lb/>
I fear and hate them all.”<lb/>

    
When he inquires<lb/>
the reason, she says: “I will tell it; you<lb/>
will be surprised to learn the bad result<lb/>
caused by an ancient crime.—But I am weary<lb/>
with unaccustomed toil; and see! a poplar<lb/>
convenient, offers a delightful shade<lb/>
and this lawn gives a good couch. Let us rest<lb/>
ourselves here on the grass.” So saying, she<lb/>
reclined upon the turf and, pillowing<lb/>
her head against his breast and mingling kisses<lb/>
with her words, she told him the following tale:<lb/>


ATALANTA

Perhaps you may have heard of a swift maid,<lb/>
who ran much faster than swift-footed men<lb/>
contesting in the race. What they have told<lb/>
is not an idle tale.—She did excel<lb/>
them all—and you could not have said<lb/>
whether her swift speed or her beauty was<lb/>
more worthy of your praise. When this maid once<lb/>
consulted with an oracle, of her<lb/>
fate after marriage, the god answered her:<lb/>
“You, Atalanta, never will have need<lb/>
of husband, who will only be your harm.<lb/>
For your best good you should avoid the tie;<lb/>
but surely you will not avoid your harm;<lb/>
and while yet living you will lose yourself.”<lb/>

    
She was so frightened by the oracle,<lb/>
she lived unwedded in far shaded woods;<lb/>
and with harsh terms repulsed insistent throngs<lb/>
of suitors. “I will not be won,” she said,<lb/>
“Till I am conquered first in speed. Contest<lb/>
the race with me. A wife and couch shall both<lb/>
be given to reward the swift, but death<lb/>
must recompense the one who lags behind.<lb/>
This must be the condition of a race.”<lb/>
Indeed she was that pitiless, but such<lb/>
the power of beauty, a rash multitude<lb/>
agreed to her harsh terms.<lb/>

    
Hippomenes<lb/>
had come, a stranger, to the cruel race,<lb/>
with condemnation in his heart against<lb/>
the racing young men for their headstrong love;<lb/>
and said, “Why seek a wife at such a risk?”<lb/>
But when he saw her face, and perfect form<lb/>
disrobed for perfect running, such a form<lb/>
as mine, Adonis, or as yours—if you<lb/>
were woman—he was so astonished he<lb/>
raised up his hands and said, “Oh pardon me<lb/>
brave men whom I was blaming, I could not<lb/>
then realize the value of the prize<lb/>
you strove for.” And as he is praising her,<lb/>
his own heart leaping with love's fire, he hopes<lb/>
no young man may outstrip her in the race;<lb/>
and, full of envy, fears for the result.<lb/>

    
“But why,” he cries, “is my chance in the race<lb/>
untried? Divinity helps those who dare.”<lb/>
But while the hero weighed it in his mind<lb/>
the virgin flew as if her feet had wings.<lb/>
Although she seemed to him in flight as swift<lb/>
as any Scythian arrow, he admired<lb/>
her beauty more; and her swift speed appeared<lb/>
in her most beautiful. The breeze bore back<lb/>
the streamers on her flying ankles, while<lb/>
her hair was tossed back over her white shoulders;<lb/>
the bright trimmed ribbons at her knees were fluttering,<lb/>
and over her white girlish body came<lb/>
a pink flush, just as when a purple awning<lb/>
across a marble hall gives it a wealth<lb/>
of borrowed hues. And while Hippomenes<lb/>
in wonder gazed at her, the goal was reached;<lb/>
and Atalanta crowned victorious<lb/>
with festal wreath.—But all the vanquished youths<lb/>
paid the death-penalty with sighs and groans,<lb/>
according to the stipulated bond.<lb/>

    
Not frightened by the fate of those young men,<lb/>
he stood up boldly in the midst of all;<lb/>
and fixing his strong eyes upon the maiden, said:<lb/>
“Where is the glory in an easy victory<lb/>
over such weaklings? Try your fate with me!<lb/>
If fortune fail to favor you, how could<lb/>
it shame you to be conquered by a man?<lb/>
Megareus of Onchestus is my father,<lb/>
his grandsire, Neptune, god of all the seas.<lb/>
I am descendant of the King of Waves:<lb/>
and add to this, my name for manly worth<lb/>
has not disgraced the fame of my descent.<lb/>
If you should prove victorious against<lb/>
this combination, you will have achieved<lb/>
a great enduring name—the only one<lb/>
who ever bested great Hippomenes.”<lb/>

    
While he was speaking, Atalanta's gaze<lb/>
grew softer, in her vacillating hopes<lb/>
to conquer and be conquered; till at last,<lb/>
her heart, unbalanced, argued in this way:<lb/>

    
“It must be some god envious of youth,<lb/>
wishing to spoil this one prompts him to seek<lb/>
wedlock with me and risk his own dear life.<lb/>
I am not worth the price, if I may judge.<lb/>
His beauty does not touch me—but I could<lb/>
be moved by it—I must consider he<lb/>
is but a boy. It is not he himself<lb/>
who moves me, but his youth. Sufficient cause<lb/>
for thought are his great courage and his soul<lb/>
fearless of death. What of his high descent;—<lb/>
great grandson of the King of all the seas?<lb/>
What of his love for me that has such great<lb/>
importance, he would perish if his fate<lb/>
denied my marriage to him? O strange boy,<lb/>
go from me while you can; abandon hope<lb/>
of this alliance stained with blood—A match<lb/>
with me is fatal. Other maids will not<lb/>
refuse to wed you, and a wiser girl<lb/>
will gladly seek your love.—But what concern<lb/>
is it of mine, when I but think of those<lb/>
who have already perished! Let him look<lb/>
to it himself; and let him die. Since he<lb/>
is not warned by his knowledge of the fate<lb/>
of many other suitors, he declares<lb/>
quite plainly, he is weary of his life.—<lb/>

    
“Shall he then die, because it must be his<lb/>
one hope to live with me? And suffer death<lb/>
though undeserved, for me because he loves?<lb/>
My victory will not ward off the hate,<lb/>
the odium of the deed! But it is not<lb/>
a fault of mine.—Oh fond, fond man, I would<lb/>
that you had never seen me! But you are<lb/>
so madly set upon it, I could wish<lb/>
you may prove much the swifter! Oh how dear<lb/>
how lovable is his young girlish face!—<lb/>
ah, doomed Hippomenes, I only wish<lb/>
mischance had never let you see me! You<lb/>
are truly worthy of a life on earth.<lb/>
If I had been more fortunate, and not<lb/>
denied a happy marriage day; I would<lb/>
not share my bed with any man but you.”<lb/>

    
All this the virgin Atalanta said;<lb/>
and knowing nothing of the power of love,<lb/>
she is so ignorant of what she does,<lb/>
she loves and does not know she is in love.<lb/>

    
Meanwhile her father and the people, all<lb/>
loudly demanded the accustomed race.<lb/>
A suppliant, the young Hippomenes<lb/>
invoked me with his anxious voice, “I pray<lb/>
to you, O Venus, Queen of Love, be near<lb/>
and help my daring—smile upon the love<lb/>
you have inspired!” The breeze, not envious,<lb/>
wafted this prayer to me; and I confess,<lb/>
it was so tender it did move my heart—<lb/>
I had but little time to give him aid.<lb/>

    
There is a field there which the natives call<lb/>
the Field Tamasus—the most prized of all<lb/>
the fertile lands of Cyprus. This rich field,<lb/>
in ancient days, was set apart for me,<lb/>
by chosen elders who decreed it should<lb/>
enrich my temples yearly. In this field<lb/>
there grows a tree, with gleaming golden leaves,<lb/>
and all its branches crackle with bright gold.<lb/>
Since I was coming from there, by some chance,<lb/>
I had three golden apples in my hand,<lb/>
which I had plucked. With them I planned to aid<lb/>
Hippomenes. While quite invisible<lb/>
to all but him, I taught him how to use<lb/>
those golden apples for his benefit.<lb/>


    
The trumpet soon gave signal for the race<lb/>
and both of them crouching flashed quickly forth<lb/>
and skimmed the surface of the sandy course<lb/>
with flying feet. You might even think those two<lb/>
could graze the sea with unwet feet and pass<lb/>
over the ripened heads of standing grain.<lb/>

    
Shouts of applause gave courage to the youth:<lb/>
the cheering multitude cried out to him:—<lb/>
“Now is the time to use your strength. Go on!<lb/>
Hippomenes! Bend to the work! You're sure<lb/>
to win!” It must be doubted who was most<lb/>
rejoiced by those brave words, Megareus' son,<lb/>
or Schoeneus' daughter. Oh, how often, when<lb/>
she could have passed him, she delayed her speed;<lb/>
and after gazing long upon his face<lb/>
reluctantly again would pass him! Now<lb/>
dry panting breath came from his weary throat—<lb/>
the goal still far away.—Then Neptune's scion<lb/>
threw one of three gold apples. Atalanta<lb/>
with wonder saw it—eager to possess<lb/>
the shining fruit, she turned out of her course,<lb/>
picked up the rolling gold. Hippomenes<lb/>
passed by her, while spectators roared applause.<lb/>
Increasing speed, she overcame delay,<lb/>
made up for time lost, and again she left<lb/>
the youth behind. She was delayed again<lb/>
because he tossed another golden apple.<lb/>
She followed him, and passed him in the race.<lb/>

    
The last part of the course remained. He cried<lb/>
“Be near me, goddess, while I use your gift.”<lb/>
With youthful might he threw the shining gold,<lb/>
in an oblique direction to the side,<lb/>
so that pursuit would mean a slow return.<lb/>
The virgin seemed to hesitate, in doubt<lb/>
whether to follow after this third prize.<lb/>

    
I forced her to turn for it; take it up;<lb/>
and, adding weight to the gold fruit, she held,<lb/>
impeded her with weight and loss of time.<lb/>
For fear my narrative may stretch beyond<lb/>
the race itself,—the maiden was outstripped;<lb/>
Hippomenes then led his prize away.<lb/>

    
Adonis, did I not deserve his thanks<lb/>
with tribute of sweet incense? But he was<lb/>
ungrateful, and, forgetful of my help,<lb/>
he gave me neither frankincense nor thanks.<lb/>
Such conduct threw me into sudden wrath,<lb/>
and, fretting at the slight, I felt I must<lb/>
not be despised at any future time.<lb/>
I told myself 'twas only right to make<lb/>
a just example of them. They were near<lb/>
a temple, hidden in the forest, which<lb/>
glorious Echion in remembered time<lb/>
had built to Rhea, Mother of the gods,<lb/>
in payment of a vow. So, wearied from<lb/>
the distance traveled, they were glad to have<lb/>
a needed rest. Hippomenes while there,<lb/>
was seized with love his heart could not control.—<lb/>
a passion caused by my divinity.<lb/>

    
Quite near the temple was a cave-like place,<lb/>
covered with pumice. It was hallowed by<lb/>
religious veneration of the past.<lb/>
Within the shadows of that place, a priest<lb/>
had stationed many wooden images<lb/>
of olden gods. The lovers entered there<lb/>
and desecrated it. The images<lb/>
were scandalized, and turned their eyes away.<lb/>
The tower-crowned Mother, Cybele, at first<lb/>
prepared to plunge the guilty pair beneath<lb/>
the waves of Styx, but such a punishment<lb/>
seemed light. And so their necks, that had been smooth.<lb/>
Were covered instantly with tawny manes;<lb/>
their fingers bent to claws; their arms were changed<lb/>
to fore-legs; and their bosoms held their weight;<lb/>
and with their tails they swept the sandy ground.<lb/>

    
Their casual glance is anger, and instead<lb/>
of words they utter growls. They haunt the woods,<lb/>
a bridal-room to their ferocious taste.<lb/>
And now fierce lions they are terrible<lb/>
to all of life; except to Cybele;<lb/>
whose harness has subdued their champing jaws.<lb/>

    
My dear Adonis keep away from all<lb/>
such savage animals; avoid all those<lb/>
which do not turn their fearful backs in flight<lb/>
but offer their bold breasts to your attack,<lb/>
lest courage should be fatal to us both.<lb/>

ADONIS TRANSFORMED

Indeed she warned him. — Harnessing her swans,<lb/>
she traveled swiftly through the yielding air;<lb/>
but his rash courage would not heed advice.<lb/>
By chance his dogs, which followed a sure track,<lb/>
aroused a wild boar from his hiding place;<lb/>
and, as he rushed out from his forest lair,<lb/>
Adonis pierced him with a glancing stroke.<lb/>

    
Infuriate, the fierce boar's curved snout<lb/>
first struck the spear-shaft from his bleeding side;<lb/>
and, while the trembling youth was seeking where<lb/>
to find a safe retreat, the savage beast<lb/>
raced after him, until at last he sank<lb/>
his deadly tusk deep in Adonis' groin;<lb/>
and stretched him dying on the yellow sand.<lb/>

    
And now sweet Aphrodite, borne through air<lb/>
in her light chariot, had not yet arrived<lb/>
at Cyprus, on the wings of her white swans.<lb/>
Afar she recognized his dying groans,<lb/>
and turned her white birds towards the sound. And when<lb/>
down looking from the lofty sky, she saw<lb/>
him nearly dead, his body bathed in blood,<lb/>
she leaped down—tore her garment—tore her hair —<lb/>
and beat her bosom with distracted hands.<lb/>
And blaming Fate said, “But not everything<lb/>
is at the mercy of your cruel power.<lb/>
My sorrow for Adonis will remain,<lb/>
enduring as a lasting monument.<lb/>
Each passing year the memory of his death<lb/>
shall cause an imitation of my grief.<lb/>

    
“Your blood, Adonis, will become a flower<lb/>
perennial. Was it not allowed to you<lb/>
Persephone, to transform Menthe's limbs<lb/>
into sweet fragrant mint? And can this change<lb/>
of my loved hero be denied to me?”<lb/>

    
Her grief declared, she sprinkled his blood with<lb/>
sweet-smelling nectar, and his blood as soon<lb/>
as touched by it began to effervesce,<lb/>
just as transparent bubbles always rise<lb/>
in rainy weather. Nor was there a pause<lb/>
more than an hour, when from Adonis, blood,<lb/>
exactly of its color, a loved flower<lb/>
sprang up, such as pomegranates give to us,<lb/>
small trees which later hide their seeds beneath<lb/>
a tough rind. But the joy it gives to man<lb/>
is short-lived, for the winds which give the flower<lb/>
its name, Anemone, shake it right down,<lb/>
because its slender hold, always so weak,<lb/>
lets it fall to the ground from its frail stem.<lb/>

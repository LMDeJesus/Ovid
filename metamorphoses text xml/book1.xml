Invocatio.
INVOCATION
My soul is wrought to sing of forms transformed<lb/>
to bodies new and strange! Immortal Gods<lb/>
inspire my heart, for ye have changed yourselves<lb/>
and all things you have changed! Oh lead my song<lb/>
in smooth and measured strains, from olden days<lb/>
when earth began to this completed time!<lb/>


THE CREATION
Mundi origo.
Before the ocean and the earth appeared—<lb/>
before the skies had overspread them all—<lb/>
the face of Nature in a vast expanse<lb/>
was naught but Chaos uniformly waste.<lb/>
It was a rude and undeveloped mass,<lb/>
that nothing made except a ponderous weight;<lb/>
and all discordant elements confused,<lb/>
were there congested in a shapeless heap.<lb/>

    
As yet the sun afforded earth no light,<lb/>
nor did the moon renew her crescent horns;<lb/>
the earth was not suspended in the air<lb/>
exactly balanced by her heavy weight.<lb/>
Not far along the margin of the shores<lb/>
had Amphitrite stretched her lengthened arms,—<lb/>
for all the land was mixed with sea and air.<lb/>
The land was soft, the sea unfit to sail,<lb/>
the atmosphere opaque, to naught was given<lb/>
a proper form, in everything was strife,<lb/>
and all was mingled in a seething mass—<lb/>
with hot the cold parts strove, and wet with dry<lb/>
and soft with hard, and weight with empty void.<lb/>

    
But God, or kindly Nature, ended strife—<lb/>
he cut the land from skies, the sea from land,<lb/>
the heavens ethereal from material air;<lb/>
and when were all evolved from that dark mass<lb/>
he bound the fractious parts in tranquil peace.<lb/>
The fiery element of convex heaven<lb/>
leaped from the mass devoid of dragging weight,<lb/>
and chose the summit arch to which the air<lb/>
as next in quality was next in place.<lb/>
The earth more dense attracted grosser parts<lb/>
and moved by gravity sank underneath;<lb/>
and last of all the wide surrounding waves<lb/>
in deeper channels rolled around the globe.<lb/>

    
And when this God —which one is yet unknown—<lb/>
had carved asunder that discordant mass,<lb/>
had thus reduced it to its elements,<lb/>
that every part should equally combine,<lb/>
when time began He rounded out the earth<lb/>
and moulded it to form a mighty globe.<lb/>
Then poured He forth the deeps and gave command<lb/>
that they should billow in the rapid winds,<lb/>
that they should compass every shore of earth. <lb/>
he also added fountains, pools and lakes,<lb/>
and bound with shelving banks the slanting streams,<lb/>
which partly are absorbed and partly join<lb/>
the boundless ocean. Thus received amid<lb/>
the wide expanse of uncontrolled waves,<lb/>
they beat the shores instead of crooked banks.<lb/>

    
At His command the boundless plains extend,<lb/>
the valleys are depressed, the woods are clothed<lb/>
in green, the stony mountains rise. And as<lb/>
the heavens are intersected on the right<lb/>
by two broad zones, by two that cut the left,<lb/>
and by a fifth consumed with ardent heat,<lb/>
with such a number did the careful God<lb/>
mark off the compassed weight, and thus the earth<lb/>
received as many climes.—Such heat consumes<lb/>
the middle zone that none may dwell therein;<lb/>
and two extremes are covered with deep snow;<lb/>
and two are placed betwixt the hot and cold,<lb/>
which mixed together give a temperate clime;<lb/>
and over all the atmosphere suspends<lb/>
with weight proportioned to the fiery sky,<lb/>
exactly as the weight of earth compares<lb/>
with weight of water.<lb/>

    
And He ordered mist<lb/>
to gather in the air and spread the clouds.<lb/>
He fixed the thunders that disturb our souls,<lb/>
and brought the lightning on destructive winds<lb/>
that also waft the cold. Nor did the great<lb/>
Artificer permit these mighty winds<lb/>
to blow unbounded in the pathless skies,<lb/>
but each discordant brother fixed in space,<lb/>
although His power can scarce restrain their rage<lb/>
to rend the universe. At His command<lb/>
to far Aurora, Eurus took his way,<lb/>
to Nabath, Persia, and that mountain range<lb/>
first gilded by the dawn; and Zephyr's flight<lb/>
was towards the evening star and peaceful shores,<lb/>
warm with the setting sun; and Boreas<lb/>
invaded Scythia and the northern snows;<lb/>
and Auster wafted to the distant south<lb/>
where clouds and rain encompass his abode.—<lb/>
and over these He fixed the liquid sky,<lb/>
devoid of weight and free from earthly dross.<lb/>

    
And scarcely had He separated these<lb/>
and fixed their certain bounds, when all the stars,<lb/>
which long were pressed and hidden in the mass,<lb/>
began to gleam out from the plains of heaven,<lb/>
and traversed, with the Gods, bright ether fields:<lb/>
and lest some part might be bereft of life<lb/>
the gleaming waves were filled with twinkling fish;<lb/>
the earth was covered with wild animals;<lb/>
the agitated air was filled with birds. <lb/>

    
But one more perfect and more sanctified,<lb/>
a being capable of lofty thought,<lb/>
intelligent to rule, was wanting still<lb/>
man was created! Did the Unknown God<lb/>
designing then a better world make man<lb/>
of seed divine? or did Prometheus<lb/>
take the new soil of earth (that still contained<lb/>
some godly element of Heaven's Life)<lb/>
and use it to create the race of man;<lb/>
first mingling it with water of new streams;<lb/>
so that his new creation, upright man,<lb/>
was made in image of commanding Gods?<lb/>
On earth the brute creation bends its gaze,<lb/>
but man was given a lofty countenance<lb/>
and was commanded to behold the skies;<lb/>
and with an upright face may view the stars:—<lb/>
and so it was that shapeless clay put on<lb/>
the form of man till then unknown to earth.<lb/>


Quattuor aetates. Gigantes.
THE FOUR AGES

First was the Golden Age. Then rectitude<lb/>
spontaneous in the heart prevailed, and faith.<lb/>
Avengers were not seen, for laws unframed<lb/>
were all unknown and needless. Punishment<lb/>
and fear of penalties existed not.<lb/>
No harsh decrees were fixed on brazen plates.<lb/>
No suppliant multitude the countenance<lb/>
of Justice feared, averting, for they dwelt<lb/>
without a judge in peace. Descended not<lb/>
the steeps, shorn from its height, the lofty pine,<lb/>
cleaving the trackless waves of alien shores,<lb/>
nor distant realms were known to wandering men.<lb/>
The towns were not entrenched for time of war;<lb/>
they had no brazen trumpets, straight, nor horns<lb/>
of curving brass, nor helmets, shields nor swords.<lb/>
There was no thought of martial pomp —secure<lb/>
a happy multitude enjoyed repose.<lb/>

    
Then of her own accord the earth produced<lb/>
a store of every fruit. The harrow touched<lb/>
her not, nor did the plowshare wound<lb/>
her fields. And man content with given food,<lb/>
and none compelling, gathered arbute fruits<lb/>
and wild strawberries on the mountain sides,<lb/>
and ripe blackberries clinging to the bush,<lb/>
and corners and sweet acorns on the ground,<lb/>
down fallen from the spreading tree of Jove.<lb/>
Eternal Spring! Soft breathing zephyrs soothed<lb/>
and warmly cherished buds and blooms, produced<lb/>
without a seed. The valleys though unplowed<lb/>
gave many fruits; the fields though not renewed<lb/>
white glistened with the heavy bearded wheat:<lb/>
rivers flowed milk and nectar, and the trees,<lb/>
the very oak trees, then gave honey of themselves.<lb/>

    
When Saturn had been banished into night<lb/>
and all the world was ruled by Jove supreme,<lb/>
the Silver Age, though not so good as gold<lb/>
but still surpassing yellow brass, prevailed.<lb/>

    
Jove first reduced to years the Primal Spring,<lb/>
by him divided into periods four,<lb/>
unequal,—summer, autumn, winter, spring.—<lb/>
then glowed with tawny heat the parched air,<lb/>
or pendent icicles in winter froze<lb/>
and man stopped crouching in crude caverns, while<lb/>
he built his homes of tree rods, bark entwined.<lb/>
Then were the cereals planted in long rows,<lb/>
and bullocks groaned beneath the heavy yoke.<lb/>

    
The third Age followed, called The Age of Bronze,<lb/>
when cruel people were inclined to arms<lb/>
but not to impious crimes. And last of all<lb/>
the ruthless and hard Age of Iron prevailed,<lb/>
from which malignant vein great evil sprung;<lb/>
and modesty and faith and truth took flight,<lb/>
and in their stead deceits and snares and frauds<lb/>
and violence and wicked love of gain,<lb/>
succeeded.—Then the sailor spread his sails<lb/>
to winds unknown, and keels that long had stood<lb/>
on lofty mountains pierced uncharted waves.<lb/>
Surveyors anxious marked with metes and bounds<lb/>
the lands, created free as light and air:<lb/>
nor need the rich ground furnish only crops,<lb/>
and give due nourishment by right required,—<lb/>
they penetrated to the bowels of earth<lb/>
and dug up wealth, bad cause of all our ills,—<lb/>
rich ores which long ago the earth had hid<lb/>
and deep removed to gloomy Stygian caves:<lb/>
and soon destructive iron and harmful gold<lb/>
were brought to light; and War, which uses both,<lb/>
came forth and shook with sanguinary grip<lb/>
his clashing arms. Rapacity broke forth—<lb/>
the guest was not protected from his host,<lb/>
the father in law from his own son in law;<lb/>
even brothers seldom could abide in peace.<lb/>
The husband threatened to destroy his wife,<lb/>
and she her husband: horrid step dames mixed<lb/>
the deadly henbane: eager sons inquired<lb/>
their fathers, ages. Piety was slain:<lb/>
and last of all the virgin deity,<lb/>
Astraea vanished from the blood-stained earth.<lb/>

GIANTS
And lest ethereal heights should long remain<lb/>
less troubled than the earth, the throne of Heaven<lb/>
was threatened by the Giants;   and they piled<lb/>
mountain on mountain to the lofty stars.<lb/>
But Jove, omnipotent, shot thunderbolts<lb/>
through Mount Olympus, and he overturned<lb/>
from Ossa huge, enormous Pelion.<lb/>
And while these dreadful bodies lay overwhelmed<lb/>
in their tremendous bulk, (so fame reports)<lb/>
the Earth was reeking with the copious blood<lb/>
of her gigantic sons; and thus replete<lb/>
with moisture she infused the steaming gore<lb/>
with life renewed. So that a monument<lb/>
of such ferocious stock should be retained,<lb/>
she made that offspring in the shape of man;  <lb/>
but this new race alike despised the Gods,<lb/>
and by the greed of savage slaughter proved<lb/>
a sanguinary birth.<lb/>


Lycaon.
LYCAON CHANGED TO A WOLF

When, from his throne<lb/>
supreme, the Son of Saturn viewed their deeds,<lb/>
he deeply groaned: and calling to his mind<lb/>
the loathsome feast Lycaon had prepared,<lb/>
a recent deed not common to report,<lb/>
his soul conceived great anger —worthy Jove— <lb/>
and he convened a council. No delay<lb/>
detained the chosen Gods.<lb/>

    
When skies are clear<lb/>
a path is well defined on high, which men,<lb/>
because so white, have named the Milky Way.<lb/>
It makes a passage for the deities<lb/>
and leads to mansions of the Thunder God,<lb/>
to Jove's imperial home. On either side<lb/>
of its wide way the noble Gods are seen,<lb/>

    
inferior Gods in other parts abide,<lb/>
but there the potent and renowned of Heaven<lb/>
have fixed their homes.—It is a glorious place,<lb/>
our most audacious verse might designate<lb/>
the “Palace of High Heaven.” When the Gods<lb/>
were seated, therefore, in its marble halls<lb/>
the King of all above the throng sat high,<lb/>
and leaning on his ivory scepter, thrice,<lb/>
and once again he shook his awful locks,<lb/>
wherewith he moved the earth, and seas and stars,—<lb/>
and thus indignantly began to speak;<lb/>

“The time when serpent footed giants strove<lb/>
to fix their hundred arms on captive Heaven,<lb/>
not more than this event could cause alarm<lb/>
for my dominion of the universe.<lb/>
Although it was a savage enemy,<lb/>
yet warred we with a single source derived<lb/>
of one. Now must I utterly destroy<lb/>
this mortal race wherever Nereus roars<lb/>
around the world. Yea, by the Infernal Streams<lb/>
that glide through Stygian groves beneath the world,<lb/>
I swear it. Every method has been tried.<lb/>
The knife must cut immedicable wounds,<lb/>
lest maladies infect untainted parts.<lb/>

“Beneath my sway are demi gods and fauns,<lb/>
nymphs, rustic deities, sylvans of the hills,<lb/>
satyrs;—all these, unworthy Heaven's abodes,<lb/>
we should at least permit to dwell on earth<lb/>
which we to them bequeathed. What think ye, Gods,<lb/>
is safety theirs when I, your sovereign lord,<lb/>
the Thunder-bolt Controller, am ensnared<lb/>
by fierce Lycaon?” Ardent in their wrath,<lb/>
the astonished Gods demand revenge overtake<lb/>
this miscreant; he who dared commit such crimes.<lb/>
'Twas even thus when raged that impious band<lb/>
to blot the Roman name in sacred blood<lb/>
of Caesar, sudden apprehensive fears<lb/>
of ruin absolute astonished man,<lb/>
and all the world convulsed. Nor is the love<lb/>
thy people bear to thee, Augustus, less<lb/>
than these displayed to Jupiter whose voice<lb/>
and gesture all the murmuring host restrained:<lb/>
and as indignant clamour ceased, suppressed<lb/>
by regnant majesty, Jove once again<lb/>
broke the deep silence with imperial words;<lb/>

“Dismiss your cares; he paid the penalty<lb/>
however all the crime and punishment<lb/>
now learn from this:—An infamous report<lb/>
of this unholy age had reached my ears,<lb/>
and wishing it were false, I sloped my course<lb/>
from high Olympus, and—although a God—<lb/>
disguised in human form I viewed the world.<lb/>
It would delay us to recount the crimes<lb/>
unnumbered, for reports were less than truth.<lb/>

“I traversed Maenalus where fearful dens<lb/>
abound, over Lycaeus, wintry slopes<lb/>
of pine tree groves, across Cyllene steep;<lb/>
and as the twilight warned of night's approach,<lb/>
I stopped in that Arcadian tyrant's realms<lb/>
and entered his inhospitable home:—<lb/>
and when I showed his people that a God<lb/>
had come, the lowly prayed and worshiped me,<lb/>
but this Lycaon mocked their pious vows<lb/>
and scoffing said; ‘A fair experiment<lb/>
will prove the truth if this be god or man.’<lb/>
and he prepared to slay me in the night,—<lb/>
to end my slumbers in the sleep of death.<lb/>
So made he merry with his impious proof;<lb/>
but not content with this he cut the throat<lb/>
of a Molossian hostage sent to him,<lb/>
and partly softened his still quivering limbs<lb/>
in boiling water, partly roasted them<lb/>
on fires that burned beneath. And when this flesh<lb/>
was served to me on tables, I destroyed<lb/>
his dwelling and his worthless Household Gods,<lb/>
with thunder bolts avenging. Terror struck<lb/>
he took to flight, and on the silent plains<lb/>
is howling in his vain attempts to speak;<lb/>
he raves and rages and his greedy jaws,<lb/>
desiring their accustomed slaughter, turn<lb/>
against the sheep—still eager for their blood.<lb/>
His vesture separates in shaggy hair,<lb/>
his arms are changed to legs; and as a wolf<lb/>
he has the same grey locks, the same hard face,<lb/>
the same bright eyes, the same ferocious look.<lb/>

THE DELUGE

“Thus fell one house, but not one house alone<lb/>
deserved to perish; over all the earth<lb/>
ferocious deeds prevail,—all men conspire<lb/>
in evil. Let them therefore feel the weight<lb/>
of dreadful penalties so justly earned,<lb/>
for such hath my unchanging will ordained.”<lb/>

    
with exclamations some approved the words<lb/>
of Jove and added fuel to his wrath,<lb/>
while others gave assent: but all deplored<lb/>
and questioned the estate of earth deprived<lb/>
of mortals. Who could offer frankincense<lb/>
upon the altars? Would he suffer earth<lb/>
to be despoiled by hungry beasts of prey?<lb/>
Such idle questions of the state of man<lb/>
the King of Gods forbade, but granted soon<lb/>
to people earth with race miraculous,<lb/>
unlike the first. <lb/>


Diluvium. Deucalion et Pyrrha.

And now his thunder bolts<lb/>
would Jove wide scatter, but he feared the flames,<lb/>
unnumbered, sacred ether might ignite<lb/>
and burn the axle of the universe:<lb/>
and he remembered in the scroll of fate,<lb/>
there is a time appointed when the sea<lb/>
and earth and Heavens shall melt, and fire destroy<lb/>
the universe of mighty labour wrought.<lb/>
Such weapons by the skill of Cyclops forged,<lb/>
for different punishment he laid aside—<lb/>
for straightway he preferred to overwhelm<lb/>
the mortal race beneath deep waves and storms<lb/>
from every raining sky. And instantly<lb/>
he shut the Northwind in Aeolian caves,<lb/>
and every other wind that might dispel<lb/>
the gathering clouds. He bade the Southwind blow:—<lb/>

    
the Southwind flies abroad with dripping wings,<lb/>
concealing in the gloom his awful face:<lb/>
the drenching rain descends from his wet beard<lb/>
and hoary locks; dark clouds are on his brows<lb/>
and from his wings and garments drip the dews:<lb/>
his great hands press the overhanging clouds;<lb/>
loudly the thunders roll; the torrents pour;<lb/>
Iris, the messenger of Juno, clad<lb/>
in many coloured raiment, upward draws<lb/>
the steaming moisture to renew the clouds.<lb/>

    
The standing grain is beaten to the ground,<lb/>
the rustic's crops are scattered in the mire,<lb/>
and he bewails the long year's fruitless toil.<lb/>

    
The wrath of Jove was not content with powers<lb/>
that emanate from Heaven; he brought to aid<lb/>
his azure brother, lord of flowing waves,<lb/>
who called upon the Rivers and the Streams:<lb/>
and when they entered his impearled abode,<lb/>
Neptune, their ancient ruler, thus began;<lb/>
“A long appeal is needless; pour ye forth<lb/>
in rage of power; open up your fountains;<lb/>
rush over obstacles;   let every stream<lb/>
pour forth in boundless floods.” Thus he commands,<lb/>
and none dissenting all the River Gods<lb/>
return, and opening up their fountains roll<lb/>
tumultuous to the deep unfruitful sea.<lb/>

    
And Neptune with his trident smote the Earth,<lb/>
which trembling with unwonted throes heaved up<lb/>
the sources of her waters bare; and through<lb/>
her open plains the rapid rivers rushed<lb/>
resistless, onward bearing the waving grain,<lb/>

    
the budding groves, the houses, sheep and men,—<lb/>
and holy temples, and their sacred urns.<lb/>
The mansions that remained, resisting vast<lb/>
and total ruin, deepening waves concealed<lb/>
and whelmed their tottering turrets in the flood<lb/>
and whirling gulf. And now one vast expanse,<lb/>
the land and sea were mingled in the waste<lb/>
of endless waves—a sea without a shore.<lb/>

    
One desperate man seized on the nearest hill;<lb/>
another sitting in his curved boat,<lb/>
plied the long oar where he was wont to plow;<lb/>
another sailed above his grain, above<lb/>
his hidden dwelling; and another hooked<lb/>
a fish that sported in a leafy elm.<lb/>
Perchance an anchor dropped in verdant fields,<lb/>
or curving keels were pushed through tangled vines;<lb/>
and where the gracile goat enjoyed the green,<lb/>
unsightly seals reposed. Beneath the waves<lb/>
were wondering Nereids, viewing cities, groves<lb/>
and houses. Dolphins darting mid the trees,<lb/>
meshed in the twisted branches, beat against<lb/>
the shaken oak trees. There the sheep, affrayed,<lb/>
swim with the frightened wolf, the surging waves<lb/>
float tigers and lions: availeth naught<lb/>
his lightning shock the wild boar, nor avails<lb/>
the stag's fleet footed speed. The wandering bird,<lb/>
seeking umbrageous groves and hidden vales,<lb/>
with wearied pinion droops into the sea.<lb/>
The waves increasing surge above the hills,<lb/>
and rising waters dash on mountain tops.<lb/>
Myriads by the waves are swept away,<lb/>
and those the waters spare, for lack of food,<lb/>
starvation slowly overcomes at last.<lb/>

    
A fruitful land and fair but now submerged<lb/>
beneath a wilderness of rising waves,<lb/>
'Twixt Oeta and Aonia, Phocis lies,<lb/>
where through the clouds Parnassus' summits twain<lb/>
point upward to the stars, unmeasured height,<lb/>
save which the rolling billows covered all:<lb/>
there in a small and fragile boat, arrived,<lb/>
Deucalion and the consort of his couch,<lb/>
prepared to worship the Corycian Nymphs,<lb/>
the mountain deities, and Themis kind,<lb/>
who in that age revealed in oracles<lb/>
the voice of fate. As he no other lived<lb/>
so good and just, as she no other feared<lb/>
the Gods.<lb/>

    
When Jupiter beheld the globe<lb/>
in ruin covered, swept with wasting waves,<lb/>
and when he saw one man of myriads left,<lb/>
one helpless woman left of myriads lone,<lb/>
both innocent and worshiping the Gods,<lb/>
he scattered all the clouds; he blew away<lb/>
the great storms by the cold northwind.<lb/>


    
Once more<lb/>
the earth appeared to heaven and the skies<lb/>
appeared to earth. The fury of the main<lb/>
abated, for the Ocean ruler laid<lb/>
his trident down and pacified the waves,<lb/>
and called on azure Triton.—Triton arose<lb/>
above the waving seas, his shoulders mailed<lb/>
in purple shells.—He bade the Triton blow,<lb/>
blow in his sounding shell, the wandering streams<lb/>
and rivers to recall with signal known:<lb/>
a hollow wreathed trumpet, tapering wide<lb/>
and slender stemmed, the Triton took amain<lb/>
and wound the pearly shell at midmost sea.<lb/>
Betwixt the rising and the setting suns<lb/>
the wildered notes resounded shore to shore,<lb/>
and as it touched his lips, wet with the brine<lb/>
beneath his dripping beard, sounded retreat:<lb/>
and all the waters of the land and sea<lb/>
obeyed. Their fountains heard and ceased to flow;<lb/>
their waves subsided; hidden hills uprose;<lb/>
emerged the shores of ocean; channels filled<lb/>
with flowing streams; the soil appeared; the land<lb/>
increased its surface as the waves decreased:<lb/>
and after length of days the trees put forth,<lb/>
with ooze on bending boughs, their naked tops.<lb/>

    
And all the wasted globe was now restored,<lb/>
but as he viewed the vast and silent world<lb/>
Deucalion wept and thus to Pyrrha spoke;<lb/>
“O sister! wife! alone of woman left!<lb/>
My kindred in descent and origin!<lb/>
Dearest companion of my marriage bed,<lb/>
doubly endeared by deepening dangers borne,—<lb/>
of all the dawn and eve behold of earth,<lb/>
but you and I are left—for the deep sea<lb/>
has kept the rest! And what prevents the tide<lb/>
from overwhelming us? Remaining clouds<lb/>
affright us. How could you endure your fears<lb/>
if you alone were rescued by this fate,<lb/>
and who would then console your bitter grief?<lb/>
Oh be assured, if you were buried in the waves,<lb/>
that I would follow you and be with you!<lb/>
Oh would that by my father's art I might<lb/>
restore the people, and inspire this clay<lb/>
to take the form of man. Alas, the Gods<lb/>
decreed and only we are living!”, Thus<lb/>
Deucalion's plaint to Pyrrha;—and they wept.<lb/>

    
And after he had spoken, they resolved<lb/>
to ask the aid of sacred oracles,—<lb/>
and so they hastened to Cephissian waves<lb/>
which rolled a turbid flood in channels known.<lb/>
Thence when their robes and brows were sprinkled well,<lb/>
they turned their footsteps to the goddess' fane:<lb/>
its gables were befouled with reeking moss<lb/>
and on its altars every fire was cold.<lb/>
But when the twain had reached the temple steps<lb/>
they fell upon the earth, inspired with awe,<lb/>
and kissed the cold stone with their trembling lips,<lb/>
and said; “If righteous prayers appease the Gods,<lb/>
and if the wrath of high celestial powers<lb/>
may thus be turned, declare, O Themis! whence<lb/>
and what the art may raise humanity?<lb/>
O gentle goddess help the dying world!”<lb/>

    
Moved by their supplications, she replied;<lb/>
“Depart from me and veil your brows; ungird<lb/>
your robes, and cast behind you as you go,<lb/>
the bones of your great mother.” Long they stood<lb/>
in dumb amazement: Pyrrha, first of voice,<lb/>
refused the mandate and with trembling lips<lb/>
implored the goddess to forgive—she feared<lb/>
to violate her mother's bones and vex<lb/>
her sacred spirit. Often pondered they<lb/>
the words involved in such obscurity,<lb/>
repeating oft: and thus Deucalion<lb/>
to Epimetheus' daughter uttered speech<lb/>
of soothing import; “ Oracles are just<lb/>
and urge not evil deeds, or naught avails<lb/>
the skill of thought. Our mother is the Earth,<lb/>
and I may judge the stones of earth are bones<lb/>
that we should cast behind us as we go.”<lb/>

    
And although Pyrrha by his words was moved<lb/>
she hesitated to comply; and both amazed<lb/>
doubted the purpose of the oracle,<lb/>
but deemed no harm to come of trial. They,<lb/>
descending from the temple, veiled their heads<lb/>
and loosed their robes and threw some stones<lb/>
behind them. It is much beyond belief,<lb/>
were not receding ages witness, hard<lb/>
and rigid stones assumed a softer form,<lb/>
enlarging as their brittle nature changed<lb/>
to milder substance,—till the shape of man<lb/>
appeared, imperfect, faintly outlined first,<lb/>
as marble statue chiseled in the rough.<lb/>
The soft moist parts were changed to softer flesh,<lb/>
the hard and brittle substance into bones,<lb/>
the veins retained their ancient name. And now<lb/>
the Gods supreme ordained that every stone<lb/>
Deucalion threw should take the form of man,<lb/>
and those by Pyrrha cast should woman's form<lb/>
assume: so are we hardy to endure<lb/>
and prove by toil and deeds from what we sprung.<lb/>


Python.
THE PYTHIAN GAMES

And after this the Earth spontaneous<lb/>
produced the world of animals, when all<lb/>
remaining moistures of the mirey fens<lb/>
fermented in the sun, and fruitful seeds<lb/>
in soils nutritious grew to shapes ordained.<lb/>
So when the seven streamed Nile from oozy fields<lb/>
returneth duly to her ancient bed,<lb/>
the sun's ethereal rays impregn the slime,<lb/>
that haply as the peasants turn the soil<lb/>
they find strange animals unknown before:<lb/>
some in the moment of their birth, and some<lb/>
deprived of limbs, imperfect; often part<lb/>
alive and part of slime inanimate<lb/>
are fashioned in one body. Heat combined<lb/>
with moisture so conceives and life results<lb/>
from these two things. For though the flames may be<lb/>
the foes of water, everything that lives<lb/>
begins in humid vapour, and it seems<lb/>
discordant concord is the means of life.<lb/>

    
When Earth, spread over with diluvian ooze,<lb/>
felt heat ethereal from the glowing sun,<lb/>
unnumbered species to the light she gave,<lb/>
and gave to being many an ancient form,<lb/>
or monster new created. Unwilling she<lb/>
created thus enormous Python.—Thou<lb/>
unheard of serpent spread so far athwart<lb/>
the side of a vast mountain, didst fill with fear<lb/>
the race of new created man. The God<lb/>
that bears the bow (a weapon used till then<lb/>
only to hunt the deer and agile goat)<lb/>
destroyed the monster with a myriad darts,<lb/>
and almost emptied all his quiver, till<lb/>
envenomed gore oozed forth from livid wounds.<lb/>

    
Lest in a dark oblivion time should hide<lb/>
the fame of this achievement, sacred sports<lb/>
he instituted, from the Python called<lb/>
“The Pythian Games.” In these the happy youth<lb/>
who proved victorious in the chariot race,<lb/>
running and boxing, with an honoured crown<lb/>
of oak leaves was enwreathed. The laurel then<lb/>
was not created, wherefore Phoebus, bright<lb/>
and godlike, beauteous with his flowing hair,<lb/>
was wont to wreathe his brows with various leaves.<lb/>


Daphne.
DAPHNE AND PHOEBUS

Daphne, the daughter of a River God<lb/>
was first beloved by Phoebus, the great God<lb/>
of glorious light. 'Twas not a cause of chance<lb/>
but out of Cupid's vengeful spite that she<lb/>
was fated to torment the lord of light.<lb/>
For Phoebus, proud of Python's death, beheld<lb/>
that impish god of Love upon a time<lb/>
when he was bending his diminished bow,<lb/>
and voicing his contempt in anger said;<lb/>

“What, wanton boy, are mighty arms to thee,<lb/>
great weapons suited to the needs of war?<lb/>
The bow is only for the use of those<lb/>
large deities of heaven whose strength may deal<lb/>
wounds, mortal, to the savage beasts of prey;<lb/>
and who courageous overcome their foes.—<lb/>
it is a proper weapon to the use<lb/>
of such as slew with arrows Python, huge,<lb/>
whose pestilential carcase vast extent<lb/>
covered. Content thee with the flames thy torch<lb/>
enkindles (fires too subtle for my thought)<lb/>
and leave to me the glory that is mine.”<lb/>

    
to him, undaunted, Venus, son replied;<lb/>
“O Phoebus, thou canst conquer all the world<lb/>
with thy strong bow and arrows, but with this<lb/>
small arrow I shall pierce thy vaunting breast!<lb/>
And by the measure that thy might exceeds<lb/>
the broken powers of thy defeated foes,<lb/>
so is thy glory less than mine.” No more<lb/>
he said, but with his wings expanded thence<lb/>
flew lightly to Parnassus, lofty peak.<lb/>
There, from his quiver he plucked arrows twain,<lb/>
most curiously wrought of different art;<lb/>
one love exciting, one repelling love.<lb/>
The dart of love was glittering, gold and sharp,<lb/>
the other had a blunted tip of lead;<lb/>
and with that dull lead dart he shot the Nymph,<lb/>
but with the keen point of the golden dart<lb/>
he pierced the bone and marrow of the God.<lb/>

    
Immediately the one with love was filled,<lb/>
the other, scouting at the thought of love,<lb/>
rejoiced in the deep shadow of the woods,<lb/>
and as the virgin Phoebe (who denies<lb/>
the joys of love and loves the joys of chase)<lb/>
a maiden's fillet bound her flowing hair,—<lb/>
and her pure mind denied the love of man.<lb/>
Beloved and wooed she wandered silent paths,<lb/>
for never could her modesty endure<lb/>
the glance of man or listen to his love.<lb/>

    
Her grieving father spoke to her, “Alas,<lb/>
my daughter, I have wished a son in law,<lb/>
and now you owe a grandchild to the joy<lb/>
of my old age.” But Daphne only hung<lb/>
her head to hide her shame. The nuptial torch<lb/>
seemed criminal to her. She even clung,<lb/>
caressing, with her arms around his neck,<lb/>
and pled, “My dearest father let me live<lb/>
a virgin always, for remember Jove<lb/>
did grant it to Diana at her birth.”<lb/>

    
But though her father promised her desire,<lb/>
her loveliness prevailed against their will;<lb/>
for, Phoebus when he saw her waxed distraught,<lb/>
and filled with wonder his sick fancy raised<lb/>
delusive hopes, and his own oracles<lb/>
deceived him.—As the stubble in the field<lb/>
flares up, or as the stacked wheat is consumed<lb/>
by flames, enkindled from a spark or torch<lb/>
the chance pedestrian may neglect at dawn;<lb/>
so was the bosom of the god consumed,<lb/>
and so desire flamed in his stricken heart.<lb/>

    
He saw her bright hair waving on her neck;—<lb/>
“How beautiful if properly arranged! ”<lb/>
He saw her eyes like stars of sparkling fire,<lb/>
her lips for kissing sweetest, and her hands<lb/>
and fingers and her arms; her shoulders white<lb/>
as ivory;—and whatever was not seen<lb/>
more beautiful must be.<lb/>

    
Swift as the wind<lb/>
from his pursuing feet the virgin fled,<lb/>
and neither stopped nor heeded as he called;<lb/>
“O Nymph! O Daphne! I entreat thee stay,<lb/>
it is no enemy that follows thee—<lb/>
why, so the lamb leaps from the raging wolf,<lb/>
and from the lion runs the timid faun,<lb/>
and from the eagle flies the trembling dove,<lb/>
all hasten from their natural enemy<lb/>
but I alone pursue for my dear love.<lb/>
Alas, if thou shouldst fall and mar thy face,<lb/>
or tear upon the bramble thy soft thighs,<lb/>
or should I prove unwilling cause of pain!<lb/>

“The wilderness is rough and dangerous,<lb/>
and I beseech thee be more careful—I<lb/>
will follow slowly.—Ask of whom thou wilt,<lb/>
and thou shalt learn that I am not a churl—<lb/>
I am no mountain dweller of rude caves,<lb/>
nor clown compelled to watch the sheep and goats;<lb/>
and neither canst thou know from whom thy feet<lb/>
fly fearful, or thou wouldst not leave me thus.<lb/>

“The Delphic Land, the Pataraean Realm,<lb/>
Claros and Tenedos revere my name,<lb/>
and my immortal sire is Jupiter.<lb/>
The present, past and future are through me<lb/>
in sacred oracles revealed to man,<lb/>
and from my harp the harmonies of sound<lb/>
are borrowed by their bards to praise the Gods.<lb/>
My bow is certain, but a flaming shaft<lb/>
surpassing mine has pierced my heart—<lb/>
untouched before. The art of medicine<lb/>
is my invention, and the power of herbs;<lb/>
but though the world declare my useful works<lb/>
there is no herb to medicate my wound,<lb/>
and all the arts that save have failed their lord.,”<lb/>


    
But even as he made his plaint, the Nymph<lb/>
with timid footsteps fled from his approach,<lb/>
and left him to his murmurs and his pain.<lb/>

    
Lovely the virgin seemed as the soft wind<lb/>
exposed her limbs, and as the zephyrs fond<lb/>
fluttered amid her garments, and the breeze<lb/>
fanned lightly in her flowing hair. She seemed<lb/>
most lovely to his fancy in her flight;<lb/>
and mad with love he followed in her steps,<lb/>
and silent hastened his increasing speed.<lb/>

    
As when the greyhound sees the frightened hare<lb/>
flit over the plain:—With eager nose outstretched,<lb/>
impetuous, he rushes on his prey,<lb/>
and gains upon her till he treads her feet,<lb/>
and almost fastens in her side his fangs;<lb/>

    
but she, whilst dreading that her end is near,<lb/>
is suddenly delivered from her fright;<lb/>
so was it with the god and virgin: one<lb/>
with hope pursued, the other fled in fear;<lb/>
and he who followed, borne on wings of love,<lb/>
permitted her no rest and gained on her,<lb/>
until his warm breath mingled in her hair.<lb/>

    
Her strength spent, pale and faint, with pleading eyes<lb/>
she gazed upon her father's waves and prayed,<lb/>
“Help me my father, if thy flowing streams<lb/>
have virtue! Cover me, O mother Earth!<lb/>
Destroy the beauty that has injured me,<lb/>
or change the body that destroys my life.”<lb/>

    
Before her prayer was ended, torpor seized<lb/>
on all her body, and a thin bark closed<lb/>
around her gentle bosom, and her hair<lb/>
became as moving leaves; her arms were changed<lb/>
to waving branches, and her active feet<lb/>
as clinging roots were fastened to the ground—<lb/>
her face was hidden with encircling leaves.—<lb/>

    
Phoebus admired and loved the graceful tree,<lb/>
(For still, though changed, her slender form remained)<lb/>
and with his right hand lingering on the trunk<lb/>
he felt her bosom throbbing in the bark.<lb/>
He clung to trunk and branch as though to twine.<lb/>
His form with hers, and fondly kissed the wood<lb/>
that shrank from every kiss.<lb/>

    
And thus the God;<lb/>
“Although thou canst not be my bride, thou shalt<lb/>
be called my chosen tree, and thy green leaves,<lb/>
O Laurel! shall forever crown my brows,<lb/>
be wreathed around my quiver and my lyre;<lb/>
the Roman heroes shall be crowned with thee,<lb/>
as long processions climb the Capitol<lb/>
and chanting throngs proclaim their victories;<lb/>
and as a faithful warden thou shalt guard<lb/>
the civic crown of oak leaves fixed between<lb/>
thy branches, and before Augustan gates.<lb/>
And as my youthful head is never shorn,<lb/>
so, also, shalt thou ever bear thy leaves<lb/>
unchanging to thy glory.,”<lb/>

    
Here the God,<lb/>
Phoebus Apollo, ended his lament,<lb/>
and unto him the Laurel bent her boughs,<lb/>
so lately fashioned; and it seemed to him<lb/>
her graceful nod gave answer to his love.<lb/>


Io. Argus. Syrinx.
IO AND JUPITER	

There is a grove in Thessaly, enclosed<lb/>
on every side with crags, precipitous,—<lb/>
on which a forest grows—and this is called<lb/>
the Vale of Tempe—through this valley flows<lb/>
the River Peneus, white with foaming waves,<lb/>
that issue from the foot of Pindus, whence<lb/>
with sudden fall up gather steamy clouds<lb/>
that sprinkle mist upon the circling trees,<lb/>
and far away with mighty roar resound.<lb/>
It is the abode, the solitary home,<lb/>
that mighty River loves, where deep in gloom<lb/>
of rocky cavern, he resides and rules<lb/>
the flowing waters and the water nymphs<lb/>
abiding there. All rivers of that land<lb/>
now hasten thither, doubtful to console<lb/>
or flatter Daphne's parent: poplar crowned<lb/>
Sperchios, swift Enipeus and the wild<lb/>
Amphrysos, old Apidanus and Aeas,<lb/>
with all their kindred streams that wandering maze<lb/>
and wearied seek the ocean. Inachus<lb/>
alone is absent, hidden in his cave<lb/>
obscure, deepening his waters with his tears—<lb/>
most wretchedly bewailing, for he deems<lb/>
his daughter Io lost. If she may live<lb/>
or roam a spirit in the nether shades<lb/>
he dares not even guess but dreads<lb/>

    
for Jove not long before had seen her while<lb/>
returning from her father's stream, and said;<lb/>
“O virgin, worthy of immortal Jove,<lb/>
although some happy mortal's chosen bride,—<lb/>
behold these shades of overhanging trees,<lb/>
and seek their cool recesses while the sun<lb/>
is glowing in the height of middle skies—”<lb/>
and as he spoke he pointed out the groves—<lb/>
“But should the dens of wild beasts frighten you,<lb/>
with safety you may enter the deep woods,<lb/>
conducted by a God—not with a God<lb/>
of small repute, but in the care of him<lb/>
who holds the heavenly scepter in his hand<lb/>
and fulminates the trackless thunder bolts.—<lb/>
forsake me not! ” For while he spoke she fled,<lb/>
and swiftly left behind the pasture fields<lb/>
of Lerna, and Lyrcea's arbours, where<lb/>
the trees are planted thickly. But the God<lb/>
called forth a heavy shadow which involved<lb/>
the wide extended earth, and stopped her flight<lb/>
and ravished in that cloud her chastity.<lb/>

    
Meanwhile, the goddess Juno gazing down<lb/>
on earth's expanse, with wonder saw the clouds<lb/>
as dark as night enfold those middle fields<lb/>
while day was bright above. She was convinced<lb/>
the clouds were none composed of river mist<lb/>
nor raised from marshy fens. Suspicious now,<lb/>
from oft detected amours of her spouse,<lb/>
she glanced around to find her absent lord,<lb/>
and quite convinced that he was far from heaven,<lb/>
she thus exclaimed; “This cloud deceives my mind,<lb/>
or Jove has wronged me.” From the dome of heaven<lb/>
she glided down and stood upon the earth,<lb/>
and bade the clouds recede. But Jove had known<lb/>
the coming of his queen. He had transformed<lb/>
the lovely Io, so that she appeared<lb/>
a milk white heifer—formed so beautiful<lb/>
and fair that envious Juno gazed on her.<lb/>
She queried: “Whose? what herd? what pasture fields?”<lb/>
As if she guessed no knowledge of the truth.<lb/>
And Jupiter, false hearted, said the cow<lb/>
was earth begotten, for he feared his queen<lb/>
might make inquiry of the owner's name.<lb/>
Juno implored the heifer as a gift.—<lb/>
what then was left the Father of the Gods?<lb/>
'Twould be a cruel thing to sacrifice<lb/>
his own beloved to a rival's wrath.<lb/>
Although refusal must imply his guilt<lb/>
the shame and love of her almost prevailed;<lb/>
but if a present of such little worth<lb/>
were now denied the sharer of his couch,<lb/>
the partner of his birth, 'twould prove indeed<lb/>
the earth born heifer other than she seemed—<lb/>
and so he gave his mistress up to her.<lb/>

    
Juno regardful of Jove's cunning art,<lb/>
lest he might change her to her human form,<lb/>
gave the unhappy heifer to the charge<lb/>
of Argus, Aristorides, whose head<lb/>
was circled with a hundred glowing eyes;<lb/>
of which but two did slumber in their turn<lb/>
whilst all the others kept on watch and guard.<lb/>

    
Whichever way he stood his gaze was fixed<lb/>
on Io—even if he turned away<lb/>
his watchful eyes on Io still remained.<lb/>
He let her feed by day; but when the sun<lb/>
was under the deep world he shut her up,<lb/>
and tied a rope around her tender neck.<lb/>

    
She fed upon green leaves and bitter herbs <lb/>
and on the cold ground slept—too often bare,<lb/>
she could not rest upon a cushioned couch.<lb/>
She drank the troubled waters. Hoping aid<lb/>
she tried to stretch imploring arms to Argus,<lb/>
but all in vain for now no arms remained;<lb/>
the sound of bellowing was all she heard,<lb/>
and she was frightened with her proper voice.<lb/>

    
Where former days she loved to roam and sport,<lb/>
she wandered by the banks of Inachus:<lb/>
there imaged in the stream she saw her horns<lb/>
and, startled, turned and fled. And Inachus<lb/>
and all her sister Naiads knew her not,<lb/>
although she followed them, they knew her not,<lb/>
although she suffered them to touch her sides<lb/>
and praise her.<lb/>

    
When the ancient Inachus<lb/>
gathered sweet herbs and offered them to her,<lb/>
she licked his hands, kissing her father's palms,<lb/>
nor could she more restrain her falling tears.<lb/>
If only words as well as tears would flow,<lb/>
she might implore his aid and tell her name<lb/>
and all her sad misfortune; but, instead,<lb/>
she traced in dust the letters of her name<lb/>
with cloven hoof; and thus her sad estate<lb/>
was known.<lb/>


“Ah wretched me! ” her father cried;<lb/>
and as he clung around her horns and neck<lb/>
repeated while she groaned, “Ah wretched me!<lb/>
Art thou my daughter sought in every clime?<lb/>
When lost I could not grieve for thee as now<lb/>
that thou art found; thy sighs instead of words<lb/>
heave up from thy deep breast, thy longings give<lb/>
me answer. I prepared the nuptial torch<lb/>
and bridal chamber, in my ignorance,<lb/>
since my first hope was for a son in law;<lb/>
and then I dreamed of children from the match:<lb/>
but now the herd may furnish thee a mate,<lb/>
and all thy issue of the herd must be.<lb/>
Oh that a righteous death would end my grief!—<lb/>
it is a dreadful thing to be a God!<lb/>
Behold the lethal gate of death is shut<lb/>
against me, and my growing grief must last<lb/>
throughout eternity.”<lb/>

    
While thus he moaned<lb/>
came starry Argus there, and Io bore<lb/>
from her lamenting father. Thence he led<lb/>
his charge to other pastures; and removed<lb/>
from her, upon a lofty mountain sat,<lb/>
whence he could always watch her, undisturbed.<lb/>

    
The sovereign god no longer could endure<lb/>
to witness Io's woes. He called his son,<lb/>
whom Maia brightest of the Pleiades<lb/>
brought forth, and bade him slay the star eyed guard,<lb/>
argus. He seized his sleep compelling wand<lb/>
and fastened waving wings on his swift feet,<lb/>
and deftly fixed his brimmed hat on his head:—<lb/>
lo, Mercury, the favoured son of Jove,<lb/>
descending to the earth from heaven's plains,<lb/>
put off his cap and wings,— though still retained<lb/>
his wand with which he drove through pathless wilds<lb/>
some stray she goats, and as a shepherd fared,<lb/>
piping on oaten reeds melodious tunes.<lb/>

    
Argus, delighted with the charming sound<lb/>
of this new art began; “Whoever thou art,<lb/>
sit with me on this stone beneath the trees<lb/>
in cooling shade, whilst browse the tended flock<lb/>
abundant herbs; for thou canst see the shade<lb/>
is fit for shepherds.” Wherefore, Mercury<lb/>
sat down beside the keeper and conversed<lb/>
of various things—passing the laggard hours.—<lb/>

    
then soothly piped he on the joined reeds<lb/>
to lull those ever watchful eyes asleep;<lb/>
but Argus strove his languor to subdue,<lb/>
and though some drowsy eyes might slumber, still<lb/>
were some that vigil kept. Again he spoke,<lb/>
(for the pipes were yet a recent art)<lb/>
“I pray thee tell what chance discovered these.”<lb/>

    
To him the God, “ A famous Naiad dwelt<lb/>
among the Hamadryads, on the cold<lb/>
Arcadian summit Nonacris, whose name<lb/>
was Syrinx. Often she escaped the Gods,<lb/>
that wandered in the groves of sylvan shades,<lb/>
and often fled from Satyrs that pursued.<lb/>
Vowing virginity, in all pursuits<lb/>
she strove to emulate Diana's ways:<lb/>
and as that graceful goddess wears her robe,<lb/>
so Syrinx girded hers that one might well<lb/>
believe Diana there. Even though her bow<lb/>
were made of horn, Diana's wrought of gold,<lb/>
vet might she well deceive.<lb/>

“Now chanced it Pan.<lb/>
Whose head was girt with prickly pines, espied<lb/>
the Nymph returning from the Lycian Hill,<lb/>
and these words uttered he: ”—But Mercury<lb/>
refrained from further speech, and Pan's appeal<lb/>
remains untold. If he had told it all,<lb/>
the tale of Syrinx would have followed thus:—<lb/>

    
but she despised the prayers of Pan, and fled<lb/>
through pathless wilds until she had arrived<lb/>
the placid Ladon's sandy stream, whose waves<lb/>
prevented her escape. There she implored<lb/>
her sister Nymphs to change her form: and Pan,<lb/>
believing he had caught her, held instead<lb/>
some marsh reeds for the body of the Nymph;<lb/>
and while he sighed the moving winds began<lb/>
to utter plaintive music in the reeds,<lb/>
so sweet and voice like that poor Pan exclaimed;<lb/>
“Forever this discovery shall remain<lb/>
a sweet communion binding thee to me.”—<lb/>
and this explains why reeds of different length,<lb/>
when joined together by cementing wax,<lb/>
derive the name of Syrinx from the maid.<lb/>


    
Such words the bright god Mercury would say;<lb/>
but now perceiving Argus' eyes were dimmed<lb/>
in languorous doze, he hushed his voice and touched<lb/>
the drooping eyelids with his magic wand,<lb/>
compelling slumber. Then without delay<lb/>
he struck the sleeper with his crescent sword,<lb/>
where neck and head unite, and hurled his head,<lb/>
blood dripping, down the rocks and rugged cliff.<lb/>

    
Low lies Argus: dark is the light of all<lb/>
his hundred eyes, his many orbed lights<lb/>
extinguished in the universal gloom<lb/>
that night surrounds; but Saturn's daughter spread<lb/>
their glister on the feathers of her bird,<lb/>
emblazoning its tail with starry gems.<lb/>

    
Juno made haste, inflamed with towering rage,<lb/>
to vent her wrath on Io; and she raised<lb/>
in thought and vision of the Grecian girl<lb/>
a dreadful Fury. Stings invisible,<lb/>
and pitiless, she planted in her breast,<lb/>
and drove her wandering throughout the globe.<lb/>

    
The utmost limit of her laboured way,<lb/>
O Nile, thou didst remain. Which, having reached,<lb/>
and placed her tired knees on that river's edge,<lb/>
she laid her there, and as she raised her neck<lb/>
looked upward to the stars, and groaned and wept<lb/>
and mournfully bellowed: trying thus to plead,<lb/>
by all the means she had, that Jupiter<lb/>
might end her miseries. Repentant Jove<lb/>
embraced his consort, and entreated her<lb/>
to end the punishment: “Fear not,” he said,<lb/>
“For she shall trouble thee no more.” He spoke,<lb/>
and called on bitter Styx to hear his oath.<lb/>

    
And now imperial Juno, pacified,<lb/>
permitted Io to resume her form,—<lb/>
at once the hair fell from her snowy sides;<lb/>
the horns absorbed, her dilate orbs decreased;<lb/>
the opening of her jaws contracted; hands<lb/>
appeared and shoulders; and each transformed hoof<lb/>
became five nails. And every mark or form<lb/>
that gave the semblance of a heifer changed,<lb/>
except her fair white skin; and the glad Nymph<lb/>
was raised erect and stood upon her feet.<lb/>
But long the very thought of speech, that she<lb/>
might bellow as a heifer, filled her mind<lb/>
with terror, till the words so long forgot<lb/>
for some sufficient cause were tried once more.<lb/>


Phaethon.
and since that time, the linen wearing throng<lb/>
of Egypt have adored her as a God;<lb/>
for they believe the seed of Jove prevailed;<lb/>
and when her time was due she bore to him<lb/>
a son called Epaphus; who also dwells<lb/>
in temples with his mother in that land.<lb/>

    
Now Phaethon, whose father was the Sun,<lb/>
was equal to his rival, Epaphus,<lb/>
in mind and years; and he was glad to boast<lb/>
of wonders, nor would yield to Epaphus<lb/>
for pride of Phoebus, his reputed sire.<lb/>
Unable to endure it, Io's son<lb/>
thus mocked him; “Poor, demented fellow, what<lb/>
will you not credit if your mother speaks,<lb/>
you are so puffed up with the fond conceit<lb/>
of your imagined sire, the Lord of Day.”<lb/>

    
shame crimsoned in his cheeks, but Phaethon<lb/>
withholding rage, reported all the taunts<lb/>
of Epaphus to Clymene his mother:<lb/>
“'Twill grieve you, mother, I, the bold and free,<lb/>
was silent; and it shames me to report<lb/>
this dark reproach remains unchallenged. Oh,<lb/>
if I am born of race divine, give proof<lb/>
of that illustrious descent and claim<lb/>
my right to Heaven.” Around his mother's neck<lb/>
he drew his arms, and by the head of Merops,<lb/>
and by his own, and by the nuptial torch<lb/>
of his beloved sisters, he implored<lb/>
for some true token of his origin.<lb/>

    
Or moved by Phaethon's importuned words,<lb/>
or by the grievous charge, who might declare?<lb/>
She raised her arms to Heaven, and gazing full<lb/>
upon the broad sun said; “I swear to you<lb/>
by yonder orb, so radiant and bright,<lb/>
which both beholds and hears us while we speak,<lb/>
that you are his begotten son.—You are<lb/>
the child of that great light which sways the world:<lb/>
and if I have not spoken what is true,<lb/>
let not mine eyes behold his countenance,<lb/>
and let this fatal moment be the last<lb/>
that I shall look upon the light of day!<lb/>
Nor will it weary you, my son, to reach<lb/>
your father's dwelling; for the very place<lb/>
where he appears at dawn is near our land.<lb/>
Go, if it please you, and the very truth<lb/>
learn from your father.” Instantly sprang forth<lb/>
exultant Phaethon. Overjoyed with words<lb/>
so welcome, he imagined he could leap<lb/>
and touch the skies. And so he passed his land<lb/>
of Ethiopia, and the Indies, hot<lb/>
beneath the tawny sun, and there he turned<lb/>
his footsteps to his father's Land of Dawn.<lb/>

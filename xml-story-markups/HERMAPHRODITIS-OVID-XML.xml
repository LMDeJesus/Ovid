    <title>HERMAPHRODITUS</title>
    <p>Learn how the fountain, <character>Salmacis</character>, became<lb/> so infamous; learn how
        it enervates<lb/> and softens the limbs of those who chance to bathe.<lb/> Although the
        fountain's properties are known,<lb/> the cause is yet unknown. The Naiads nursed<lb/> an
        infant son of <name>Hermes</name>, surely his<lb/> of <name>Aphrodite</name> gotten in the
        caves <lb/> of Ida, for the child resembled both<lb/> the god and goddess, and his name was
        theirs.<lb/></p>

    <p>The years passed by, and when the boy had reached<lb/> the limit of three lustrums, he
        forsook<lb/> his native mountains; for he loved to roam<lb/> through unimagined places, by
        the banks<lb/> of undiscovered rivers; and the joy<lb/> of finding wonders made his labour
        light.<lb/></p>

    <p>Leaving <place>Mount Ida</place>, where his youth was spent,<lb/> he reached the land of
            <place>Lycia</place>, and from thence<lb/> the verge of <place>Caria</place>, where a
        pretty pool<lb/> of soft translucent water may be seen,<lb/> so clear the glistening bottom
        glads the eye:<lb/> no barren sedge, no fenny reeds annoy,<lb/> no rushes with their
        sharpened arrow-points,<lb/> but all around the edges of that pool<lb/> to rapid-running
            <name>Dian</name>. Whensoever<lb/> her Naiad sisters pled in winged words,<lb/>
        <dia speaker="naiads" gender="female">“Take up the javelin, sister
                <character>Salmacis</character>,<lb/> take up the painted quiver and unite<lb/> your
            leisure with the action of the chase;”</dia><lb/> she only scorned the javelin and the
        quiver,<lb/> nor joined her leisure to the active chase.<lb/></p>
    <p>Rather she bathes her smooth and shapely limbs;<lb/> or combs her tresses with a boxwood
        comb,<lb/> Citorian; or looking in the pool<lb/> consults the glassed waters of effects<lb/>
        increasing beauty; or she decks herself<lb/> in gauzy raiment, and reposing lolls<lb/> on
        cushioned leaves, or grass-enverdured beds;<lb/> or gathers posies from the spangled
        lawns.<lb/> Now, haply as she culled the sweetest flowers<lb/> she saw the youth, and
        longing in her heart<lb/>
        <desire object="hermaphroditis" perp="salamacis">made havoc as her greedy eyes
            beheld.</desire><lb/></p>
    <p>Although her love could scarcely brook delay,<lb/> she waited to enhance her loveliness,<lb/>
        in beauty hoping to allure his love.<lb/> All richly dight she scanned herself and
        robes,<lb/> to know that every charm should fair appear,<lb/> and she be worthy: wherefore
        she began:<lb/></p>
    <p><dia speaker="salamacis" gender="female">“O godlike youth! if thou art of the skies,<lb/>
            thou art no other than the god of Love;<lb/> if mortal, blest are they who gave thee
            birth;<lb/> happy thy brother; happy, fortunate<lb/> thy sister; happy, fortunate and
            blest<lb/> the nurse that gave her bosom; but the joys<lb/> surpassing all, dearest and
            tenderest,<lb/> are hers whom thou shalt wed. So, let it be<lb/> if thou so young have
            deigned to marry, let<lb/> my joys be stolen; if unmarried, join<lb/> with me in
            wedlock.”</dia>So she spoke, and stood<lb/> in silence waiting for the youth's
        reply.<lb/></p>

    <p>He knows nor cares for love—with loveliness<lb/> the mounting blushes tinge his youthful
        cheeks,<lb/> as blush-red tint of apples on the tree,<lb/> ripe in the summer sun, or as the
        hue<lb/> of painted ivory, or the round moon<lb/> red-blushing in her splendour, when the
        clash<lb/> of brass resounds in vain. And long the Nymph<lb/> implored; almost clung on his
        neck, as smooth<lb/> and white as ivory; unceasingly<lb/> imploring him to kiss her, though
        as chaste<lb/> as kisses to a sister; but the youth<lb/> outwearied, thus:<lb/></p>
    <p><dia speaker="hermaphroditis" gender="non-binary">“I do beseech you make<lb/> an end of this;
            or must I fly the place<lb/> and leave you to your tears?”</dia> Affrighted then<lb/>
        said <character>Salmacis</character>, <dia speaker="salamacis" gender="female">“To you I
            freely give—<lb/> good stranger here remain.”</dia> Although she made<lb/> fair presence
        to retire, she hid herself,<lb/> that from a shrub-grown covert, on her knees<lb/> she might
        observe unseen.<lb/></p>

    <p>As any boy<lb/> that heedless deems his mischief unobserved,<lb/> now here now there, he
        rambled on the green;<lb/> now in the bubbly ripples dipped his feet,<lb/> now dallied in
        the clear pool ankle-deep;—<lb/> the warm-cool feeling of the liquid then,<lb/> so pleased
        him, that without delay he doffed<lb/> his fleecy garments from his tender limbs.<lb/></p>
    <p>Ah, <character>Salmacis</character>, amazement is thy meed!<lb/> Thou art consumed to know
        his naked grace!<lb/> As the hot glitters of the round bright sun<lb/> collected, sparkle
        from the polished plate,<lb/> thine eyes are glistened with delirious fires.<lb/></p>

    <p>Delay she cannot; panting for his joy,<lb/>
        <desire object="hermaphroditis" perp="salamacis">languid for his caressing, crazed,
            distract,<lb/> her passion difficult is held in check</desire>.—<lb/></p>

    <p>He claps his body with his hollow palms<lb/> and lightly vaults into the limped wave,<lb/>
        and darting through the water hand over hand<lb/> shines in the liquid element, as
        though<lb/> should one enhance a statue's ivorine,<lb/> or glaze the lily in a lake of
        glass.<lb/></p>

    <p>And thus the Naiad, <dia speaker="salamacis" gender="female">“I have gained my suit;<lb/> his
            love is mine,—is mine!”</dia> Quickly disrobed,<lb/> she plunged into the yielding
        wave—seized him,<lb/> caressed him, clung to him a thousand ways,<lb/> kissed him, thrust
        down her hands and touched his breast:<lb/> reluctant and resisting he endeavours<lb/> to
        make escape, but even as he struggles<lb/> she winds herself about him, as entwines<lb/> the
        serpent which the royal bird on high<lb/> holds in his talons; —as it hangs, it coils<lb/>
        in sinuous folds around the eagle's feet;—<lb/> twisting its coils around his head and
        wings:<lb/> or as the ivy clings to sturdy oaks;<lb/> or as the polypus beneath the
        waves,<lb/> by pulling down, with suckers on all sides,<lb/> tenacious holds its prey. And
        yet the youth,<lb/> descendant of great <name>Atlas</name>, not relents<lb/> nor gives the
        Naiad joy. Pressing her suit<lb/> she winds her limbs around him and exclaims,<lb/>
        <dia speaker="salamacis" gender="female">“You shall not scape me, struggle as you will,<lb/>
            perverse and obstinate! Hear me, ye Gods!<lb/> Let never time release the youth from
            me;<lb/> time never let me from the youth release!”</dia><lb/></p>

    <p>Propitious deities accord her prayers:<lb/> the mingled bodies of the pair unite<lb/> and
        fashion in a single human form.<lb/> So one might see two branches underneath<lb/> a single
        rind uniting grow as one:<lb/> so, these two bodies in a firm embrace<lb/> no more are
        twain, but with a two-fold form<lb/> nor man nor woman may be called—Though both<lb/> in
        seeming they are neither one of twain.<lb/></p>

    <p>When that <character>Hermaphroditus</character> felt the change,<lb/> so wrought upon him by
        the languid fount,<lb/> considered that he entered it a man,<lb/> and now his limbs relaxing
        in the stream<lb/>
        <transform type="physical" gender="non-binary">he is not wholly male, but only
            half</transform>,—<lb/> he lifted up his hands and thus implored,<lb/> albeit with no
        manly voice; “Hear me<lb/>
        <dia speaker="hermaphroditis" gender="non-binary" invo="hermes">O father!</dia>
        <dia speaker="hermaphroditis" gender="non-binary" invo="aphrodite">hear me mother!</dia>
        grant to me<lb/> this boon; to me whose name is yours, your son;<lb/> whoso shall enter in
        this fount a man<lb/> must leave its <lb/> the softest grass engirdles with its
        green.<lb/></p>

    <p>A Nymph dwells there, unsuited to the chase,<lb/> unskilled to bend the bow, slothful of
        foot,<lb/> the only Naiad in the world unknownwaters only half a man.”<lb/> Moved by the
        words of their bi-natured son<lb/> both parents yield assent: they taint the fount<lb/> with
        essences of dual-working powers.<lb/> Now though the daughters of <name>King
        Minyas</name><lb/> have made an end of telling tales, they make<lb/> no end of labour; for
        they so despise<lb/> the deity, and desecrate his feast.<lb/></p>

    <p>While busily engaged, with sudden beat<lb/> they hear resounding tambourines; and pipes<lb/>
        and crooked horns and tinkling brass renew,<lb/> unseen, the note; saffron and myrrh
        dissolve<lb/> in dulcet odours; and, beyond belief,<lb/> the woven webs, dependent on the
        loom,<lb/> take tints of green, put forth new ivy leaves,<lb/> or change to grape-vines
        verdant. There the thread<lb/> is twisted into tendrils, there the warp<lb/> is fashioned
        into many-moving leaves—<lb/> the purple lends its splendour to the grape.<lb/></p>

    <p>And now the day is past; it is the hour<lb/> when night ambiguous merges into day,<lb/> which
        dubious owns nor light nor dun obscure;<lb/> and suddenly the house begins to shake,<lb/>
        and torches oil-dipped seem to flare around,<lb/> and fires a-glow to shine in every
        room,<lb/> and phantoms, feigned of savage beasts, to howl.—<lb/></p>

    <p>Full of affright amid the smoking halls<lb/> the sisters vainly hide, and wheresoever<lb/>
        they deem security from flaming fires,<lb/> fearfully flit. And while they seek to
        hide,<lb/> a membrane stretches over every limb,<lb/> and light wings open from their
        slender arms.<lb/></p>

    <p>In the weird darkness they are unaware<lb/> what measure wrought to change their wonted
        shape.<lb/> No plumous vans avail to lift their flight,<lb/> yet fair they balance on
        membraneous wing.<lb/> Whenever they would speak a tiny voice,<lb/> diminutive, apportioned
        to their size,<lb/> in squeaking note complains. Adread the light,<lb/> their haunts avoid
        by day the leafy woods,<lb/> for sombre attics, where secure they rest<lb/> till forth the
        dun obscure their wings may stretch<lb/> at hour of Vesper;—this accords their
        name.<lb/></p>

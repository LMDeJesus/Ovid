            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>Salvete Omnes! The Metamorphoses is a collection of narrative poems that tells important stories from Roman mythological anthologies as well as Roman history. The poem was written in 8 CE by Roman poet Ovid, with its original language being in Latin. 
                
                The Metamorphoses, while controversial in its creation, has inspired many pieces of sculpture and art as well as writers such as William Shakespeare and Dante Aligheri. The poem covers a myriad of themes and topics and uses the framework of mythology to discuss social issues around gender, sex, and desire.
                
                The goal of this project is to explore the gendered difference between desire, objectification, and agency. In the text, how does gender predetermine agency, and therefore the ability to desire? Who has the social acceptance to desire and be desired? As researchers, we want to understand the representations of gender in an ancient influential text as well as how this informs our understanding of gender, sex, and desire today.

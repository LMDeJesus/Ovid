            <p>Salvete Omnes! Welcome to our project. The goal of this project is to explore the
                gendered difference between desire, objectification, and agency in Ovid's <i>The
                    Metamorphoses</i>. In the text, how does gender predetermine agency, and
                therefore the ability to desire? Who has the social acceptance to desire and be
                desired? As researchers, we want to understand the representations of gender in an
                ancient influential text as well as how this informs our understanding of gender,
                sex, and desire today. </p>

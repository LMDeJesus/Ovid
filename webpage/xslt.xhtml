         <h2>Text</h2><strong>Pallas et Arachne.</strong><p>All this <span class="hoverable female_character">Minerva heard; and she approved<br/>
               their songs and their resentment; but her heart</span><span class="char_hover">cocky</span><br/> was brooding thus, “It is an easy thing<br/> to praise another, I should
            do as they:<br/> no creature of the earth should ever slight<br/> the majesty that
            dwells in me,—without<br/> just retribution.”—So her thought was turned<br/> upon
            the fortune of <span class="hoverable female_character">Arachne — proud,<br/> who would
               not ever yield to her the praise<br/> won by the art of deftly weaving wool,<br/> a girl
               who had not fame for place of birth,<br/> nor fame for birth, but only fame for
               skill!</span><span class="char_hover">cocky</span><br/></p>
         <p>For it was well known that her father dwelt<br/> in Colophon; where, at his
            humble trade,<br/> he dyed in Phocean purples, fleecy wool.<br/> Her mother, also of the
            lower class,<br/> had died. Arachne in a mountain
            town<br/> by skill had grown so famous in the Land<br/> of Lydia, that
            unnumbered curious nymphs<br/> eager to witness her dexterity,<br/> deserted the lush
            vineyards of Timolus;<br/> or even left the cool and flowing streams<br/> of
            bright Pactolus, to admire the cloth,<br/> or to observe her deftly spinning
            wool.<br/></p>
         <p>So graceful was her motion then,—if she<br/> was twisting the coarse wool in little
            balls,<br/> or if she teased it with her finger-tips,<br/> or if she softened the fine
            fleece, drawn forth<br/> in misty films, or if she twirled the smooth<br/> round spindle
            with her energetic thumb,<br/> or if with needle she embroidered cloth;—<br/></p>
         <p>in all her motions one might well perceive<br/> how much <span class="hoverable female_character">Minerva had instructed her:<br/> but this she ever would deny,
               displeased<br/> to share her fame;</span><span class="char_hover">cocky</span> and said, “Let her contend<br/> in art with me; and if her skill prevails,<br/> I
            then will forfeit all!”<br/></p>
         <p>Minerva heard,<br/> and came to her, disguised with
            long grey hair,<br/> and with a staff to steady her weak limbs.<br/> She seemed a feeble
            woman, very old,<br/> and quavered as she said, <span class="hoverable female_dia">“Old
               age is not<br/> the cause of every ill; experience comes<br/> with lengthened years;
               and, therefore, you should not<br/> despise my words. It is no harm in you<br/> to long
               for praise of mortals, when<br/> your nimble hands are spinning the soft wool,—<br/> but
               you should not deny Minerva's art—<br/> and you should pray that she may pardon
               you,<br/> for she will grant you pardon if you ask.”</span><span class="dia_hover">sp: minerva<br/>invo: arachne</span><br/>
            </p>
         <p><span class="hoverable female_character">Arachne, scowling with an evil face.<br/> Looked at
               the goddess, as she dropped her thread.<br/> She hardly could restrain her threatening
               hand,<br/> and, trembling in her anger,</span><span class="char_hover">rage</span>she replied<br/> to you, disguised
            Minerva:<br/>
            </p>
         <p><span class="hoverable female_dia">“Silly fool,—<br/> worn out and witless in your
               palsied age,<br/> a great age is your great misfortune!— Let<br/> your daughter and your
               son's wife—if the Gods<br/> have blessed you—let them profit by your words;<br/> within
               myself, my knowledge is contained<br/> sufficient; you need not believe that your<br/>
               advice does any good; for I am quite<br/> unchanged in my opinion. Get you gone,—<br/>
               advise your goddess to come here herself,<br/> and not avoid the
               contest!”</span><span class="dia_hover">sp: arachne<br/>invo: minerva</span><br/></p>
         <p>Instantly,<br/> the goddess said, <span class="hoverable female_dia"> “Minerva comes to
               you!”</span><span class="dia_hover">sp: minerva<br/>invo: arachne</span><br/> And with those brief words, put aside the shape<br/> of the old woman,
            and revealed herself,<br/> Minerva, goddess.<br/></p>
         <p>All the other Nymphs<br/> and matrons of Mygdonia worshiped her;<br/> but not
            Arachne, who defiant stood;—<br/>
            <span class="hoverable female_character">although at first she flushed up—then went pale—<br/> then blushed
               again, reluctant.</span><span class="char_hover">joy</span>—So, at first,<br/> the sky suffuses, as
            Aurora moves,<br/> and, quickly when the glorious sun comes up,<br/> pales
            into white.<br/></p>
         <p><span class="hoverable female_character">She even rushed upon<br/> her own destruction, for
               she would not give<br/> from her desire to gain the victory.</span><span class="char_hover">cocky</span><br/> Nor did
            the daughter of almighty Jove<br/> decline: disdaining to delay with
            words,<br/> she hesitated not.<br/></p>
         <p>And both, at once,<br/> selected their positions, stretched their webs<br/> with finest warp,
            and separated warp with sley.<br/> The woof was next inserted in the web<br/> by means of
            the sharp shuttles, which<br/> their nimble fingers pushed along, so drawn<br/> within the
            warp, and so the teeth notched in<br/> the moving sley might strike them.—Both, in
            haste,<br/> girded their garments to their breasts and moved<br/> their skilful arms,
            beguiling their fatigue<br/> in eager action.<br/></p>
         <p>Myriad tints appeared<br/> besides the Tyrian purple—royal dye,<br/> extracted in brass
            vessels.—As the bow,<br/> that spans new glory in the curving sky,<br/> its glittering rays
            reflected in the rain,<br/> spreads out a multitude of blended tints,<br/> in scintillating
            beauty to the sight<br/> of all who gaze upon it; — so the threads,<br/> inwoven, mingled in
            a thousand tints,<br/> harmonious and contrasting; shot with gold:<br/> and there, depicted
            in those shining webs,<br/> were shown the histories of ancient days:—<br/></p>
         <p>Minerva worked the Athenian Hill of Mars,<br/> where
            ancient Cecrops built his citadel,<br/> and showed the old contention for the name<br/> it
            should be given.—Twelve celestial Gods<br/> surrounded Jupiter, on lofty
            thrones;<br/> and all their features were so nicely drawn,<br/> that each could be
            distinguished.—Jupiter<br/> appeared as monarch of those judging
            Gods.<br/></p>
         <p>There Neptune, guardian of the sea, was shown<br/> contending with Minerva. As he struck<br/> the Rock with his long trident, a
            wild horse<br/> sprang forth which he bequeathed to man. He claimed<br/> his right to name
            the city for that gift.<br/></p>
         <p>And then she wove a portrait of herself,<br/> bearing a shield, and in her hand a lance,<br/>
            sharp-pointed, and a helmet on her head—<br/> her breast well-guarded by her
            Aegis: there<br/> she struck her spear into the fertile earth,<br/> from
            which a branch of olive seemed to sprout,<br/> pale with new clustered fruits.—And those
            twelve Gods,<br/> appeared to judge, that olive as a gift<br/> surpassed the horse which
            Neptune gave to man.<br/></p>
         <p>And, so Arachne, rival of her fame,<br/> might learn
            the folly of her mad attempt,<br/> from the great deeds of ancient histories,<br/> and what
            award presumption must expect,<br/>
            Minerva wove four corners with life scenes<br/> of
            contest, brightly colored, but of size<br/> diminutive.<br/></p>
         <p>In one of these was shown<br/> the snow-clad mountains, Rhodope,<br/> and
            Haemus, <span class="hoverable _transform">which for punishment were changed<br/>
               from human beings to those rigid forms</span><span class="trans_hover">physical</span>,<br/> when they aspired to rival the
            high Gods.<br/> And in another corner she described<br/> that Pygmy, whom the
            angry Juno changed<br/> from <span class="hoverable female_transform">queen-ship to a crane</span><span class="trans_hover">physical</span>; because she thought<br/> herself an equal of the
            living Gods,<br/> she was commanded to wage cruel wars<br/> upon her former subjects. In the
            third,<br/> she wove the story of Antigone,<br/> who dared compare herself to
            Juno, queen<br/> of Jupiter, and showed her as she was<br/>
            <span class="hoverable female_transform">transformed into a silly chattering
               stork</span><span class="trans_hover">physical</span>,<br/> that praised her beauty, with her ugly beak.—<br/> Despite the
            powers of Ilion and her sire<br/>
            Laomedon, her shoulders fledged white wings.<br/> And so, the third part
            finished, there was left<br/> one corner, where Minerva deftly worked<br/> the story of the father,
            Cinyras;—<br/> as he was weeping on the temple steps,<br/> which once had been
            his daughter's living limbs.<br/> And she adorned the border with designs<br/> of peaceful
            olive—her devoted tree—<br/> which having shown, she made an end of work.<br/></p>
         <p>Arachne, of Maeonia, wove, at first<br/> the story of
            Europa, as the bull<br/> deceived her, and so perfect was her art,<br/> it
            seemed a real bull in real waves.<br/>
            Europa seemed to look back towards the land<br/> which she had left; and call
            in her alarm<br/> to her companions—and as if she feared<br/> the touch of dashing waters,
            to draw up<br/> her timid feet, while she was sitting on<br/> the bull's back.<br/></p>
         <p>And she wove Asteria seized<br/> by the assaulting eagle; and beneath the
            swan's<br/> white wings showed Leda lying by the stream:<br/></p>
         <p>and showed Jove dancing as a Satyr, when<br/> he sought the beautiful
            Antiope,<br/> to whom was given twins; and how he seemed<br/>
            Amphitryon when he deceived Alcmena;<br/> and how he courted
            lovely Danae<br/> luring her as a gleaming shower of gold;<br/> and poor
            Aegina, hidden in his flame,<br/> jove as a shepherd with
            Mnemosyne;<br/> and beautiful Proserpina, involved<br/> by
            him, apparent as a spotted snake.<br/></p>
         <p>And in her web, Arachne wove the scenes<br/> of
            Neptune:—who was shown first as a bull,<br/> when he was deep in love with
            virgin Arne<br/> then as Enipeus when the giant twins,<br/>
            Aloidae, were begot; and as the ram<br/> that gambolled with
            Bisaltis; as a horse<br/>
            <span class="hoverable female_character">loved by the fruitful Ceres,
               golden haired,<br/> all-bounteous mother of the yellow grain</span><span class="char_hover">matronly</span>;<br/> and as
            the bird that hovered round snake-haired<br/>
            Medusa, mother of the winged horse;<br/> and as the dolphin, sporting with the Nymph,<br/>
            Melantho.—All of these were woven true<br/> to life, in proper shades.<br/></p>
         <p>And there she showed<br/>
            Apollo, when disguised in various forms:<br/> as when he seemed a rustic; and
            as when<br/> he wore hawk-wings, and then the tawny skin<br/> of a great lion; and once more
            when he<br/> deluded Isse, as a shepherd lad.<br/></p>
         <p>And there was Bacchus, when he was disguised<br/> as a large cluster of
            fictitious grapes;<br/> deluding by that wile the beautiful<br/>
            Erigone;—and Saturn, as a steed,<br/> begetter of the dual-natured
            Chiron.<br/></p>
         <p>And then Arachne, to complete her work,<br/> wove all
            around the web a patterned edge<br/> of interlacing flowers and ivy leaves.<br/></p>
         <p><span class="hoverable female_character">Minerva could not find a fleck or flaw—<br/>
               even Envy can not censure perfect art—<br/> enraged</span><span class="char_hover">jealous</span> because Arachne had such skill<br/> she ripped the web, and ruined
            all the scenes<br/> that showed those wicked actions of the Gods;<br/> and with her boxwood
            shuttle in her hand,<br/> struck the unhappy mortal on her head,—<br/> struck sharply
            thrice, and even once again.<br/></p>
         <p><span class="hoverable female_character">Arachne's spirit, deigning not to brook<br/> such
               insult, brooded on it, till she tied<br/> a cord around her neck, and hung
               herself.</span><span class="char_hover">rage</span><br/></p>
         <p><span class="hoverable female_character">Minerva, moved to pity at the sight,<br/> sustained
               and saved her from that bitter death;<br/> but, angry still, pronounced another
               doom:</span><span class="char_hover">rage</span><br/>
            “Although I grant you life, most wicked one,<br/>
            your fate shall be to dangle on a cord,<br/> and your posterity forever shall<br/> take
            your example, that your punishment<br/> may last forever!” Even as she spoke,<br/>
            before withdrawing from her victim's sight,<br/> she sprinkled her with juice—extract of
            herbs<br/> of Hecate.<br/></p>
         <p><span class="hoverable female_transform">At once all hair fell off,<br/> her nose and ears remained not,
               and her head<br/> shrunk rapidly in size, as well as all<br/> her body, leaving her
               diminutive.—<br/> Her slender fingers gathered to her sides<br/> as long thin legs; and
               all her other parts<br/> were fast absorbed in her abdomen—whence<br/> she vented a fine
               thread;—and ever since,<br/> Arachne as a spider, weaves her web.</span><span class="trans_hover">physical</span><br/></p>

                     <li>“In vain I've
                        striven to subdue my heart: some god it must be, which I cannot tell, is
                        working to destroy my hapless life; or else it is the burning flame of
                        love that in me rages. If it is not love, why do the mandates of my father
                        seem too harsh? They surely are too harsh. Why do I fear that he may
                        perish whom I have seen only once? What is the secret cause that I am
                        agitated by such fears?— It is no other than the god of
                        Love.</li>
                     <li>but some deluding power is holding me helpless
                        against my will. Desire persuades me one way, but my reason still
                        persuades another way. I see a better course and I approve, but follow its
                        defeat.</li>
                     <li>in his dear embrace forget my fears— or if for anything I suffer
                        dread, it will be only for the one I love.</li>
                     <li>dying flames leaped up again. Her cheeks grew red, then all her
                        face went pale again; as a small spark when hid beneath the ashes, if fed by a
                        breath of wind grows and regains its strength, as it is fanned to life; so now her
                        love that had been smoldering, and which you would have thought was almost
                        dead, when she had see again his manly youth, blazed up once
                        more.</li>
                     <li>her modesty
                        restrained her heart, eagerly longed to fold him in her arms, but careful of
                        her good name, held aloof,— rejoicing in deep, silent love; and she
                        acknowledged to the Gods her mighty gift of incantations.</li>

                     <li>loved at sight with a consuming flame</li>
                     <li>Although she struggled to suppress her love, unable
                        to restrain herself</li>
                     <li>“In vain I've
                        striven to subdue my heart: some god it must be, which I cannot tell, is
                        working to destroy my hapless life; or else it is the burning flame of
                        love that in me rages. If it is not love, why do the mandates of my father
                        seem too harsh? They surely are too harsh. Why do I fear that he may
                        perish whom I have seen only once? What is the secret cause that I am
                        agitated by such fears?— It is no other than the god of
                        Love.</li>
                     <li>but some deluding power is holding me helpless
                        against my will. Desire persuades me one way, but my reason still
                        persuades another way. I see a better course and I approve, but follow its
                        defeat.</li>
                     <li>in his dear embrace forget my fears— or if for anything I suffer
                        dread, it will be only for the one I love.</li>
                     <li>dying flames leaped up again. Her cheeks grew red, then all her
                        face went pale again; as a small spark when hid beneath the ashes, if fed by a
                        breath of wind grows and regains its strength, as it is fanned to life; so now her
                        love that had been smoldering, and which you would have thought was almost
                        dead, when she had see again his manly youth, blazed up once
                        more.</li>
                     <li>her modesty
                        restrained her heart, eagerly longed to fold him in her arms, but careful of
                        her good name, held aloof,— rejoicing in deep, silent love; and she
                        acknowledged to the Gods her mighty gift of incantations.</li>

                        reined in the nervous steed, and took his helmet off, showing his fearless

                        but with a fierce abandon would destroy whatever checked her passion. Who is

                        are harbored in the hearts of mortals! Through his villainous desire he gathered
                        praise, and many lauded him for the great love he bore his

                        each caress was his; and so his fire increased. He even wished he were her

            <ul class="cast">
               <li><strong>Perpetrator: </strong><ul>
                     <li>when
                        he saw the beautiful and blushing
                        virgin, was consumed with love</li>
                     <li>Her modest beauty was a worthy cause of worthy
                        love; but by his heritage, derived from a debasing clime,
                        his love was base; and fires unholy burned within from his own lawless
                        nature, just as fierce as are the habits of his evil
                        race.</li>
                     <li>In the wild frenzy of his wicked heart, he
                        thought he would corrupt her trusted maid, her tried attendants, and corrupt
                        even her virtue with large presents:</li>
                     <li>His hypocritic eyes were filled with tears, as
                        though they represented her desire— and, O you Gods above, what devious ways
                        are harbored in the hearts of mortals! Through his villainous desire he gathered
                        praise, and many lauded him for the great love he bore his
                        wife.</li>
                     <li>Tereus viewed her
                        pretty pleading, and in his hot heart, imagined he was then embracing her; and
                        as he saw her kiss her father's lips, her arms around his neck, it seemed that
                        each caress was his; and so his fire increased. He even wished he were her
                        father; though, if it were so, his passion would no less be
                        impious.</li>
                     <li>who, sleepless, imaged in
                        his doting mind the form of Philomela, recalled the shape of
                        her fair hands, and in his memory reviewed her movements. And his flaming
                        heart pictured her beauties yet unseen.—He fed his frenzy on itself, and
                        could not sleep.</li>
                     <li>He scarcely could control his barbarous
                        desire—with difficulty stayed his lust, he followed all her actions with hot
                        eyes.</li>

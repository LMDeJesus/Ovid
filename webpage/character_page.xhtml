                     <li>but some deluding power is holding me helpless

                        persuades another way. I see a better course and I approve, but follow its
                        defeat.</li>

                     <li>dying flames leaped up again. Her cheeks grew red, then all her
                        face went pale again; as a small spark when hid beneath the ashes, if fed by a
                        breath of wind grows and regains its strength, as it is fanned to life; so now her
                        love that had been smoldering, and which you would have thought was almost
                        dead, when she had see again his manly youth, blazed up once
                        more.</li>
                     <li>her modesty
                        restrained her heart, eagerly longed to fold him in her arms, but careful of
                        her good name, held aloof,— rejoicing in deep, silent love; and she
                        acknowledged to the Gods her mighty gift of incantations.</li>

                        love that had been smoldering, and which you would have thought was almost
                        dead, when she had see again his manly youth, blazed up once
                        more.</li>
                     <li>her modesty
                        restrained her heart, eagerly longed to fold him in her arms, but careful of
                        her good name, held aloof,— rejoicing in deep, silent love; and she
                        acknowledged to the Gods her mighty gift of incantations.</li>

                        but with a fierce abandon would destroy whatever checked her passion. Who is

                        her fair hands, and in his memory reviewed her movements. And his flaming
                        heart pictured her beauties yet unseen.—He fed his frenzy on itself, and
                        could not sleep.</li>

                        desire—with difficulty stayed his lust, he followed all her actions with hot
                        eyes.</li>

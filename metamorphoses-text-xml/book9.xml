Achelous et Hercules.
HERCULES AND ACHELOUS

To him the hero, who proclaimed himself<lb/>
a favored son of Neptune, answered now;<lb/>
“Declare the reason of your heavy sighs,<lb/>
and how your horn was broken?” And at once<lb/>
the Calydonian River-God replied,<lb/>
binding with reeds his unadorned rough locks:<lb/>

    
“It is a mournful task you have required,<lb/>
for who can wish to tell his own disgrace?<lb/>
But truly I shall speak without disguise,<lb/>
for my defeat, if rightly understood,<lb/>
should be my glory.—Even to have fought<lb/>
in battle with a hero of such might,<lb/>
affords me consolation.<lb/>

    
“Deianira<lb/>
(you may have heard some tales of her) was once<lb/>
the envied hope of many. She was then<lb/>
a lovely virgin.—I, among the rest<lb/>
who loved this maiden, entered the fair home<lb/>
of her great father Oeneus, and I said;<lb/>

    
“ ‘Consider all my claims, Parthaon's son,<lb/>
for I am come to plead your daughter's cause<lb/>
and mine—So you may make me son-in-law.,—’<lb/>
no sooner was it said, than Hercules<lb/>
in such words also claimed the virgin's hand:<lb/>
all others quickly yielded to our claims.<lb/>

    
“He boasted his descent from Jupiter;<lb/>
the glory of his labors and great deeds<lb/>
performed at his unjust stepmother's wish.<lb/>

    
“But as he was not then a God, it seemed<lb/>
disgraceful if my state should yield my right;<lb/>
so I contended with these haughty words,<lb/>
‘Why should this alien of a foreign land,<lb/>
contending for your daughter, match himself<lb/>
to me! king of the waters in this realm!<lb/>
For as I wind around, across your lands,<lb/>
I must be of your people, and a part<lb/>
of your great state. Oh, let it not be said,<lb/>
because the jealous Juno had no thought<lb/>
to punish me by labors, my descent<lb/>
is not so regal! This tremendous boast,<lb/>
that you, Alcmena's son, are sprung from Jove,<lb/>
falls at the touch of truth;—or it reveals<lb/>
the shame of a weak mother, who so gained<lb/>
your doubtful glory of descent from Heaven!<lb/>
Prove your descent from Jupiter is false,<lb/>
or else confess you are the son of shame!’<lb/>

    
“But Hercules, unable to control<lb/>
the flame of his great wrath, scowled as I spoke.<lb/>
He briefly answered me, ‘My hand excels<lb/>
my tongue; let me now overcome in fight,<lb/>
and I may suffer your offence of words.’<lb/>

    
“Full of unvented rage he rushed on me,<lb/>
but firm I stood, ashamed to yield a foot—<lb/>
I had so largely boasted, no retreat was left,<lb/>
and so I doffed my green robe—Striking guard,<lb/>
with clenched hands doubled at my breast,<lb/>
I stood my ground. He scooped up in his hand<lb/>
fine, yellow dust; and tossed it on the air<lb/>
so that the tawny powder sprinkled us;<lb/>
quick-shifting then he sought to strike my neck,<lb/>
or feint at my quick-moving legs, and turn<lb/>
swift moving to attack me at all points.<lb/>
But as a huge cliff in the sea remains<lb/>
unmoved, unshaken by the sounding waves,<lb/>
so my great size, against his vain attacks,<lb/>
defended me securely—Back we went;<lb/>
retiring for a space; then rushed again<lb/>
together, furious, and with foot to foot,<lb/>
determined not to yield, defiant stood,<lb/>
till, forward-bending from my waist and hips,<lb/>
I pressed my forehead against his and locked<lb/>
his fingers into mine: so, have I seen<lb/>
two strong bulls rush in combat for the good<lb/>
of some smooth heifer in the pasture—while<lb/>
the herd a-tremble and uncertain, wait;<lb/>
ready to give allegiance to the one<lb/>
most worthy of dominion.<lb/>

    
“Thrice in vain<lb/>
Hercules strove to push my breast from his,<lb/>
but I pressed ever closer—till, the fourth<lb/>
attempt succeeding, he unloosed my grip,<lb/>
and breaking from my circling arms drew back,<lb/>
and struck me such a buffet with his hand,<lb/>
it twisted me about, and instantly<lb/>
he clung with all his weight upon my back—<lb/>

    
“Believe me I have not suppressed the truth.<lb/>
Nor shall I try to gain applause not due:<lb/>
I seemed to bear a mountain on my back. —<lb/>
straining and dripping sweat, I broke his hold,—<lb/>
with great exertion I unlocked his grip.<lb/>
He pressed upon me, as I strained for breath,<lb/>
preventing a renewal of my strength,<lb/>
and seized upon my neck. Then at the last,<lb/>
my bent knee went down on the gritty earth,<lb/>
I bit the sand. So, worsted in my strength,<lb/>
I sought diversion by an artifice,<lb/>
and changed me to a serpent.—I then slipped<lb/>
from his tight clutches my great length, and coiled<lb/>
my body now transformed to snaky folds—<lb/>
hissing I darted my divided tongue.<lb/>

    
“But Hercules, Alcides, only laughed<lb/>
and in derision of my scheming, said,<lb/>
‘It was the pastime of my cradle days<lb/>
to strangle better snakes than you—and though<lb/>
your great length may excel all of your kind,<lb/>
how small a part of that Lernaean snake<lb/>
would you—one serpent be? It grew from wounds<lb/>
I gave (at first it had one hundred heads)<lb/>
and every time I severed one head from<lb/>
its neck two grew there in the place of one,<lb/>
by which its strength increased. This creature then<lb/>
outbranching with strong serpents, sprung from death<lb/>
and thriving on destruction, I destroyed.—<lb/>
What do you think will then become of you,<lb/>
disguised so in deceitful serpent-form,<lb/>
wielding a borrowed weapon not your own<lb/>

    
“And after he had ridiculed me thus,<lb/>
he gouged his fingers underneath my jaws,<lb/>
so that my throat was tortured, as if squeezed<lb/>
with forceps, while I struggled in his grip.<lb/>

    
“Twice was I vanquished, there remained to me<lb/>
a third form so again I changed to seem<lb/>
a savage bull, and with my limbs renewed<lb/>
in that form fought once more. He threw his arms<lb/>
about the left side of my ponderous neck,<lb/>
and dragging on me followed as I ran.<lb/>
He seized on my hard horns, and, tugging turned<lb/>
and twisted me, until he fastened them<lb/>
firm in the surface of the earth; and pushed<lb/>
me, helpless, to the shifting sand beneath.<lb/>
Not yet content he laid his fierce right hand<lb/>
on my tough horn, and broke and tore it from<lb/>
my mutilated head.—This horn, now heaped<lb/>
with fruits delicious and sweet-smelling flowers,<lb/>
the Naiads have held sacred from that hour,<lb/>
devoted to the bounteous goddess Plenty.’<lb/>

    
All this the River-god said; then a nymph,<lb/>
a lovely nymph like fair Diana dressed,<lb/>
whose locks were flowing down on either side,<lb/>
came graceful to the board, and brought to them<lb/>
of Autumn's plenty in an ample horn,<lb/>
and gave to them selected apples for<lb/>
a second course.<lb/>

    
And now, as early dawn<lb/>
appeared, and as the rising sunlight flashed<lb/>
on golden summits of surrounding hills,<lb/>
the young men waited not until the stream<lb/>
subsiding, had resumed its peaceful way,<lb/>
but all arose, reluctant, and went forth.<lb/>

    
Then Achelous, in his moving waves,<lb/>
hid his fine rustic features and his head,<lb/>
scarred by the wound which gave the Horn of Plenty.<lb/>


Nessus. Herculis mors.
NESSUS AND THE DEATH OF HERCULES

Loss of his horn had greatly humbled him,<lb/>
it was so cherished though his only loss, —<lb/>
but he could hide the sad disgrace with reeds<lb/>
and willow boughs entwined about his head.<lb/>

    
O, Nessus! your fierce passion for the same<lb/>
maid utterly destroyed even you, pierced through<lb/>
the body by a flying arrow-point.<lb/>

    
Returning to the city of his birth<lb/>
great Hercules, the son of Jupiter,<lb/>
with his new bride, arrived upon the bank<lb/>
of swift Evenus—after winter rains<lb/>
had swollen it so far beyond its wont,<lb/>
that, full of eddies, it was found to be<lb/>
impassable. The hero stood there, brave<lb/>
but anxious for his bride. Nessus, the centaur,<lb/>
strong-limbed and well-acquainted with those fords,<lb/>
came up to him and said, “Plunge in the flood<lb/>
and swim with unimpeded strength—for with<lb/>
my help she will land safely over there.”<lb/>

    
And so the hero, with no thought of doubt,<lb/>
trusted the damsel to the centaur's care,<lb/>
though she was pale and trembling with her fear<lb/>
of the swift river and the centaur's aid.<lb/>

    
This done, the hero, burdened as he was<lb/>
with quiver and the lion skin (for he<lb/>
had tossed his club and curving bow across<lb/>
the river to the other bank), declared,<lb/>
“Since I have undertaken it, at once<lb/>
this rushing water must be overcome.”<lb/>
And instantly, he plunged in without thought<lb/>
of where he might cross with most ease, for so<lb/>
he scorned to take advantage of smooth water.<lb/>

    
And after he had gained the other bank,<lb/>
while picking up his bow which there was thrown,<lb/>
he heard his wife's voice, anxious for his help.<lb/>
He called to Nessus who was in the act<lb/>
then to betray his trust: “Vain confidence!<lb/>
You are not swift enough, vile ravisher!<lb/>
You two-formed monster Nessus, I warn you!<lb/>
Hear me, and never dare to come between<lb/>
me and my love. If fear has no restraint,<lb/>
your father's dreadful fate on whirling wheel,<lb/>
should frighten you from this outrageous act:<lb/>
for you cannot escape, although you trust<lb/>
the fleet-foot effort of a rapid horse.<lb/>
I cannot overtake you with my feet<lb/>
but I can shoot and halt you with a wound.”<lb/>

    
his deed sustained the final warning word.<lb/>
He shot an arrow through the centaur's back,<lb/>
so that the keen barb was exposed beyond<lb/>
his bleeding breast. He tore it from both wounds,<lb/>
and life-blood spurted instantly, mixed with<lb/>
the deadly poison of Lernaean hydra.<lb/>
This Nessus caught, and muttering, “I shall not<lb/>
die unavenged”, he gave his tunic, soaked<lb/>
with blood to Deianira as a gift;<lb/>
and said, “Keep this to strengthen waning love.”<lb/>

    
Now many years passed by, and all the deeds,<lb/>
and labors of the mighty Hercules,<lb/>
gave to the wide world his unequalled fame;<lb/>
and finally appeased the hatred of<lb/>
his fierce stepmother.<lb/>

    
All victorious<lb/>
returning from Oechalia, he prepared<lb/>
to offer sacrifice, when at Cenaeum,<lb/>
upon an altar he had built to Jupiter,<lb/>
but tattling Rumor, swollen out of truth<lb/>
from small beginning to a wicked lie,<lb/>
declared brave Hercules, Amphitryon's son,<lb/>
was burning for the love of Iole.<lb/>
And Deianira—his fond wife—convinced<lb/>
herself, the wicked rumor must be true.<lb/>

    
Alarmed at the report of his new love,<lb/>
at first, poor wife, she was dissolved in tears,<lb/>
and then she sank in grievous misery.<lb/>
But soon in angry mood, she rose and said:<lb/>

    
“Why should I give up to my sorrow while<lb/>
I drown my wretched spirit in weak tears?<lb/>
Let me consider an effectual check—<lb/>
while it is possible—even before<lb/>
she comes, invader of my lawful bed:<lb/>
shall I be silent or complain of it?<lb/>
Must I go back to Calydon or stay?<lb/>
Shall I depart unbidden, from my house?<lb/>
Or, if no other method can prevail,<lb/>
shall I oppose my rival's first approach?<lb/>
O shade of Meleager, let me prove<lb/>
I am yet worthy to be called your sister;<lb/>
and in the desperate slaughter of this rival,<lb/>
the world, astonished, may be taught to fear<lb/>
the vengeance of an injured woman's rage.”<lb/>

    
So, torn by many moods, at last her mind<lb/>
fixed on one thought:—she might still keep his love,<lb/>
could certainly restore it, if she sent<lb/>
to him the tunic soaked in Nessus' blood.<lb/>

    
Unknowingly, she gave the fatal cause<lb/>
of her own woe to trusting Lichas, whom<lb/>
she urged in gentle words to take the gift,<lb/>
from her to her loved husband Hercules.<lb/>
He, unsuspecting, put the tunic on,<lb/>
all covered with Lernaean hydra's poison.<lb/>

    
The hero then was casting frankincense<lb/>
into the sacred flames, and pouring wine<lb/>
on marble altars, as his holy prayers<lb/>
were floating to the Gods. The hallowed heat<lb/>
striking upon his poisoned vesture, caused<lb/>
Echidna-bane to melt into his flesh.<lb/>

    
As long as he was able he withstood<lb/>
the torture. His great fortitude was strong.<lb/>
But when at last his anguish overcame<lb/>
even his endurance, he filled all the wild<lb/>
of Oeta with his cries: he overturned<lb/>
those hallowed altars, then in frenzied haste<lb/>
he strove to pull the tunic from his back.<lb/>
The poisoned garment, cleaving to him, ripped<lb/>
his skin, heat-shriveled, from his burning flesh.<lb/>
Or, tightening on him, as his great strength pulled,<lb/>
stripped with it the great muscles from his limbs,<lb/>
leaving his huge bones bare.<lb/>

    
Even his blood<lb/>
audibly hissed, as red-hot blades when they<lb/>
are plunged in water, so the burning bane<lb/>
boiled in his veins. Great perspiration streamed<lb/>
from his dissolving body, as the heat<lb/>
consumed his entrails; and his sinews cracked,<lb/>
brittle when burnt. The marrow in his bones<lb/>
dissolved, as it absorbed the venom-heat.<lb/>

There was no limit to his misery;<lb/>
raising both hands up towards the stars of heaven,<lb/>
he cried, “Come Juno, feast upon my death;<lb/>
feast on me, cruel one, look down from your<lb/>
exalted seat; behold my dreadful end<lb/>
and glut your savage heart! Oh, if I may<lb/>
deserve some pity from my enemy,<lb/>
from you I mean, this hateful life of mine<lb/>
take from me—sick with cruel suffering<lb/>
and only born for toil. The loss of life<lb/>
will be a boon to me, and surely is<lb/>
a fitting boon, such as stepmothers give!<lb/>

    
“Was it for this I slew Busiris, who<lb/>
defiled his temples with the strangers' blood?<lb/>
For this I took his mother's strength from fierce<lb/>
antaeus—that I did not show a fear<lb/>
before the Spanish shepherd's triple form?<lb/>
Nor did I fear the monstrous triple form<lb/>
of Cerberus.—And is it possible<lb/>
my hands once seized and broke the strong bull's horns?<lb/>
And Elis knows their labor, and the waves<lb/>
of Stymphalus, and the Parthenian woods.<lb/>
For this the prowess of these hands secured<lb/>
the Amazonian girdle wrought of gold;<lb/>
and did my strong arms, gather all in vain<lb/>
the fruit when guarded by the dragon's eyes.<lb/>
The centaurs could not foil me, nor the boar<lb/>
that ravaged in Arcadian fruitful fields.<lb/>
Was it for this the hydra could not gain<lb/>
double the strength from strength as it was lost?<lb/>
And when I saw the steeds of Thrace, so fat<lb/>
with human blood, and their vile mangers heaped<lb/>
with mangled bodies, in a righteous rage<lb/>
I threw them to the ground, and slaughtered them,<lb/>
together with their master! In a cave<lb/>
I crushed the Nemean monster with these arms;<lb/>
and my strong neck upheld the wide-spread sky!<lb/>
And even the cruel Juno, wife of Jove—<lb/>
is weary of imposing heavy toils,<lb/>
but I am not subdued performing them.<lb/>

    
“A new calamity now crushes me,<lb/>
which not my strength, nor valor, nor the use<lb/>
of weapons can resist. Devouring flames<lb/>
have preyed upon my limbs, and blasting heat<lb/>
now shrivels the burnt tissue of my frame.<lb/>
But still Eurystheus is alive and well!<lb/>
And there are those who yet believe in Gods!”<lb/>

    
Just as a wild bull, in whose body spears<lb/>
are rankling, while the frightened hunter flies<lb/>
away for safety, so the hero ranged<lb/>
over sky-piercing Oeta; his huge groans,<lb/>
his awful shrieks resounding in those cliffs.<lb/>
At times he struggles with the poisoned robe.<lb/>
Goaded to fury, he has razed great trees,<lb/>
and scattered the vast mountain rocks around!<lb/>
And stretched his arms towards his ancestral skies!<lb/>

    
So, in his frenzy, as he wandered there,<lb/>
he chanced upon the trembling Lichas, crouched<lb/>
in the close covert of a hollow rock.<lb/>
Then in a savage fury he cried out,<lb/>
“Was it you, Lichas, brought this fatal gift?<lb/>
Shall you be called the author of my death?”<lb/>
Lichas, in terror, groveled at his feet,<lb/>
and begged for mercy—“Only let me live!”<lb/>
But seizing on him, the crazed Hero whirled<lb/>
him thrice and once again about his head,<lb/>
and hurled him, shot as by a catapult,<lb/>
into the waves of the Euboic Sea.<lb/>

    
While he was hanging in the air, his form<lb/>
was hardened; as, we know, rain drops may first<lb/>
be frozen by the cold air, and then change<lb/>
to snow, and as it falls through whirling winds<lb/>
may press, so twisted, into round hailstones:<lb/>
even so has ancient lore declared that when<lb/>
strong arms hurled Lichas through the mountain air<lb/>
through fear, his blood was curdled in his veins.<lb/>
No moisture left in him, he was transformed<lb/>
into a flint-rock. Even to this day,<lb/>
a low crag rising from the waves is seen<lb/>
out of the deep Euboean Sea, and holds<lb/>
the certain outline of a human form,<lb/>
so sure]y traced, the wary sailors fear<lb/>
to tread upon it, thinking it has life,<lb/>
and they have called it Lichas ever since.<lb/>

    
But, O illustrious son of Jupiter!<lb/>
How many of the overspreading trees,<lb/>
thick-growing on the lofty mountain-peak<lb/>
of Oeta, did you level to the ground,<lb/>
and heap into a pyre! And then you bade<lb/>
obedient Philoctetes light a torch<lb/>
beneath it, and then take in recompense<lb/>
your bow with its capacious quiver full<lb/>
of arrows, arms that now again would see<lb/>
the realm of Troy. And as the pyre began<lb/>
to kindle with the greedy flames, you spread<lb/>
the Nemean lion skin upon the top,<lb/>
and, club for pillow, you lay down to sleep,<lb/>
as placid as if, with abounding cups<lb/>
of generous wine and crowned with garlands, you<lb/>
were safe, reclining on a banquet-couch.<lb/>

    
And now on every side the spreading flames<lb/>
were crackling fiercely, as they leaped from earth<lb/>
upon the careless limbs of Hercules.<lb/>
He scorned their power. The Gods felt fear<lb/>
for earth's defender and their sympathy<lb/>
gave pleasure to Saturnian Jove — he knew<lb/>
their thought—and joyfully he said to them:<lb/>

    
“Your sudden fear is surely my delight,<lb/>
O heavenly Gods! my heart is lifted up<lb/>
and joy prevails upon me, in the thought<lb/>
that I am called the Father and the King<lb/>
of all this grateful race of Gods. I know<lb/>
my own beloved offspring is secure<lb/>
in your declared protection: your concern<lb/>
may justly evidence his worth, whose deeds<lb/>
great benefits bestowed. Let not vain thoughts<lb/>
alarm you, nor the rising flames of Oeta;<lb/>
for Hercules who conquered everything,<lb/>
shall conquer equally the spreading fires<lb/>
which now you see: and all that part of him,<lb/>
celestial — inherited of me—<lb/>
immortal, cannot feel the power of death.<lb/>
It is not subject to the poison-heat.<lb/>
And therefore, since his earth-life is now lost,<lb/>
him I'll translate, unshackled from all dross,<lb/>
and purified, to our celestial shore.<lb/>
I trust this action seems agreeable<lb/>
to all the Deities surrounding me.<lb/>
If any jealous god of heaven should grieve<lb/>
at the divinity of Hercules,<lb/>
he may begrudge the prize but he will know<lb/>
at least 'twas given him deservedly,<lb/>
and with this thought he must approve the deed.”<lb/>

    
The Gods confirmed it: and though Juno seemed<lb/>
to be contented and to acquiesce,<lb/>
her deep vexation was not wholly hid,<lb/>
when Jupiter with his concluding words<lb/>
so plainly hinted at her jealous mind.<lb/>

    
Now, while the Gods conversed, the mortal part<lb/>
of Hercules was burnt by Mulciber;<lb/>
but yet an outline of a spirit-form<lb/>
remained. Unlike the well-known mortal shape<lb/>
derived by nature of his mother, he<lb/>
kept traces only of his father, Jove.<lb/>

    
And as a serpent, when it is revived<lb/>
from its old age, casts off the faded skin,<lb/>
and fresh with vigor glitters in new scales,<lb/>
so, when the hero had put off all dross,<lb/>
his own celestial, wonderful appeared,<lb/>
majestic and of godlike dignity.<lb/>

    
And him, the glorious father of the Gods<lb/>
in the great chariot drawn by four swift steeds,<lb/>
took up above the wide-encircling clouds,<lb/>
and set him there amid the glittering stars.<lb/>


Alcmene et Galanthis.
GALANTHIS

Even Atlas felt the weight of Heaven increase,<lb/>
but King Eurystheus, still implacable,<lb/>
vented his baffled hatred on the sons<lb/>
of the great hero. Then the Argive mother,<lb/>
Alcmena, spent and anxious with long cares,<lb/>
the burden of her old age and her fears,<lb/>
could pass the weary hours with Iole<lb/>
in garrulous narrations of his worth,<lb/>
his mighty labors and her own sad days.<lb/>
Iole, by command of Hercules,<lb/>
had been betrothed to Hyllus, and by him<lb/>
was gravid, burdened with a noble child.<lb/>
And so to Iole, Alcmena told<lb/>
this story of the birth of Hercules:—<lb/>

    
“Ah, may the Gods be merciful to you<lb/>
and give you swift deliverance in that hour<lb/>
when needful of all help you must call out<lb/>
for Ilithyia, the known goddess of<lb/>
all frightened mothers in their travail, she<lb/>
whom Juno's hatred overcame and made<lb/>
so dreadful against me. For, when my hour<lb/>
of bearing Hercules was very near,<lb/>
and when the tenth sign of the zodiac<lb/>
was traversed by the sun, my burden then<lb/>
became so heavy, and the one I bore<lb/>
so large, you certainly could tell that Jove<lb/>
must be the father of the unborn child.<lb/>

    
“At last, no longer able to endure—<lb/>
ah me, a cold sweat seizes on me now;<lb/>
only to think of it renews my pains!<lb/>
Seven days in agony, as many nights,<lb/>
exhausted in my dreadful misery,<lb/>
I stretched my arms to heaven and invoked<lb/>
Lucina and three Nixian deities<lb/>
the guardians of birth. Lucina came;<lb/>
but before then she had been pledged to give<lb/>
my life to cruel Juno. While Lucina<lb/>
sat on the altar near the door and listened,<lb/>
with her right knee crossed over her left knee,<lb/>
with fingers interlocked, she stopped the birth:<lb/>
and in low muttered tones she chanted Charms<lb/>
which there prevented my deliverance.<lb/>

    
“I fiercely struggled, and insane with pain<lb/>
shrieked vain revilings against Jupiter;<lb/>
I longed for death, and my delirious words<lb/>
then should have moved the most unfeeling rocks.<lb/>
The Theban matrons, eager to help me,<lb/>
stood near me while they asked the aid of Heaven.<lb/>

    
“And there was present of the common class,<lb/>
my maid Galanthis—with her red-gold hair—<lb/>
efficient and most willing to obey<lb/>
her worthy character deserved my love.<lb/>
She felt assured, Juno unjustly worked<lb/>
some spell of strong effect against my life.<lb/>
And when this maid beheld Lucina perched<lb/>
so strangely on the altar, with her fingers<lb/>
inwoven on her knees and tightly pressed<lb/>
together, in a gripping finger-comb,<lb/>
she guessed that jealous Juno was the cause.<lb/>
Quick-witted, in a ringing voice this maid<lb/>
cried out, ‘Congratulations! All is well!<lb/>
Alcmena is delivered—a fine child<lb/>
so safely brought forth—her true prayers approved!’<lb/>

    
“Lucina, who presides at birth, surprised<lb/>
leaped up, unclenched her hands, as one amazed.<lb/>
Just as her hands unfastened, and her knees<lb/>
were parted from their stricture, I could feel<lb/>
the bonds of stricture loosen; and without<lb/>
more labor was delivered of my child.<lb/>

    
“'Tis said, Galanthis laughed and ridiculed<lb/>
the cheated deity; and as she laughed<lb/>
the vixen goddess caught her by the hair<lb/>
and dragging her upon the ground, while she<lb/>
was struggling to arise, held her, and there<lb/>
transformed both of her arms to animal<lb/>
forelegs. Her old activity remained;<lb/>
her hair was not changed, but she did not keep<lb/>
her maiden form: and ever since that day,<lb/>
because she aided with deceitful lips,<lb/>
her offspring are brought forth through the same mouth.<lb/>
Changed to a weasel she dwells now with me.”<lb/>


Dryope. Iolaus.

When she had ended the sad tale, she heaved<lb/>
a deep sigh, in remembrance of her tried,<lb/>
beloved servant; and her daughter-in-law<lb/>
Iole kindly answered in these words:<lb/>

DRYOPE

“O my dear mother, if you weep because<lb/>
of her who was your servant, now transformed<lb/>
into a weasel, how can you support<lb/>
the true narration of my sister's fate;<lb/>
which I must tell to you, although my tears<lb/>
and sorrows hinder and forbid my speech?<lb/>

    
“Most beautiful of all Oechalian maids,<lb/>
was Dryope, her mother's only child,<lb/>
for you must know I am the daughter of<lb/>
my father's second wife. She is not now<lb/>
a maid; because, through violence of him<lb/>
who rules at Delphi and at Delos, she<lb/>
was taken by Andraemon, who since then<lb/>
has been accounted happy in his wife.<lb/>

    
“There is a lake surrounded by sweet lawns,<lb/>
encircling beauties, where the upper slope<lb/>
is crowned with myrtles in fair sunny groves.<lb/>
Without a thought of danger Dryope<lb/>
in worship one day went to gather flowers,<lb/>
(who hears, has greater cause to be indignant)<lb/>
delightful garlands, for the water-nymphs,<lb/>
and, in her bosom, carried her dear son,<lb/>
not yet a year old, whom she fed for love.<lb/>
Not far from that dream-lake, in moisture grew<lb/>
a lotus, beautiful in purple bloom,<lb/>
the blossoms promising its fruit was near.<lb/>

    
“At play with her sweet infant, Dryope<lb/>
plucked them as toys for him. I, too, was there,<lb/>
eagerly, also, I put forth my hand,<lb/>
and was just ready to secure a spray,<lb/>
when I was startled by some drops of blood<lb/>
down-falling from the blossoms which were plucked;<lb/>
and even the trembling branches shook in dread.<lb/>

    
“Who wills, the truth of this may learn from all<lb/>
quaint people of that land, who still relate<lb/>
the Story of Nymph Lotis. She, they say,<lb/>
while flying from the lust of Priapus,<lb/>
was transformed quickly from her human shape,<lb/>
into this tree, though she has kept her name.<lb/>

    
“But ignorant of all this, Dryope,<lb/>
alarmed, decided she must now return;<lb/>
so, having first adored the hallowed nymphs,<lb/>
upright she stood, and would have moved away,<lb/>
but both her feet were tangled in a root.<lb/>
There, as she struggled in its tightening hold,<lb/>
she could move nothing save her upper parts;<lb/>
and growing from that root, live bark began<lb/>
to gather slowly upward from the ground,<lb/>
spreading around her, till it touched her loins:<lb/>
in terror when she saw the clinging growth,<lb/>
she would have torn her hair out by the roots,<lb/>
but, when she clutched at it, her hands were filled<lb/>
with lotus leaves grown up from her changed head.<lb/>

    
“Alas, her little son, Amphissos, felt<lb/>
his mother's bosom harden to his touch,<lb/>
and no life-stream refreshed his eager lips.<lb/>
And while I saw your cruel destiny,<lb/>
O my dear sister! and could give no help,<lb/>
I clung to your loved body and around<lb/>
the growing trunk and branches, hoping so<lb/>
to stop their evil growth; and I confess,<lb/>
endeavored there to hide beneath the bark.<lb/>

    
“And, oh! Andraemon and her father, then<lb/>
appeared to me while they were sadly seeking<lb/>
for Dryope: so there I had to show<lb/>
the lotus as it covered her, and they<lb/>
gave kisses to the warm wood, and prostrate fell<lb/>
upon the ground, and clung to growing roots<lb/>
of their new darling tree, transformed from her.—<lb/>
Dear sister, there was nothing of yourself<lb/>
remaining but your face; and I could see<lb/>
your tears drop slowly on the trembling leaves<lb/>
which had so marvellously grown on you;<lb/>
and while your lips remained uncovered, all<lb/>
the air surrounding, echoed your complaint:—<lb/>

    
“If oaths of wretched women can have force,<lb/>
I swear I have not merited this fate!<lb/>
Though innocent, to suffer punishment!<lb/>
And if one word of my complaint is false,<lb/>
I pray I may soon wither, and my leaves<lb/>
fall from me as in blight, and let the axe<lb/>
devote me, wretched to the flames. But take<lb/>
this infant from my branches to a nurse;<lb/>
and let him often play beneath his tree,—<lb/>
his mother always. Let him drink his milk<lb/>
beneath my shade. When he has learned to talk<lb/>
let him salute me, and in sorrow say<lb/>
“In this tree-trunk my mother is concealed.”<lb/>
O, let him dread the fate that lurks in ponds,<lb/>
and let him often play beneath his tree,—<lb/>
and let him be persuaded every shrub<lb/>
contains the body of a goddess. — Ah!<lb/>
Farewell my husband,—sister, — and farewell<lb/>
my father! If my love remain in you<lb/>
remember to protect my life from harm,<lb/>
so that the pruning-knife may never clip<lb/>
my branches, and protect my foliage from<lb/>
the browsing sheep.<lb/>

    
“I cannot stoop to you;<lb/>
0h, if you love me, lift your lips to mine,<lb/>
and let me kiss you, if but once again,<lb/>
before this growing lotus covers me.<lb/>
Lift up my darling infant to my lips.<lb/>
How can I hope to say much more to you?<lb/>
The new bark now is creeping up my neck,<lb/>
and creeping downward from my covered brow!<lb/>
Ah, do not close my live eyes with your hands;<lb/>
there is no need of it, for growing bark<lb/>
will spread and darken them before I die!’<lb/>
Such were the last words her poor smothered lips<lb/>
could utter; for she was so quickly changed;<lb/>
and long thereafter the new branches kept<lb/>
the warmth of her lost body, so transformed.”<lb/>

IOLAUS

And all the while that Iole told this,<lb/>
tearful in sorrow for her sister's fate,<lb/>
Alcmena weeping, tried to comfort her.<lb/>
But as they wept together, suddenly<lb/>
a wonderful event astonished them;<lb/>
for, standing in the doorway, they beheld<lb/>
the old man Iolaus, known to them,<lb/>
but now transformed from age to youth, he seemed<lb/>
almost a boy, with light down on his cheeks:<lb/>
for Juno's daughter Hebe, had renewed<lb/>
his years to please her husband, Hercules.<lb/>
Just at the time when ready to make oath,<lb/>
she would not grant such gifts to other men—<lb/>
Themis had happily prevented her.<lb/>

    
“For even now,” she said, “a civil strife<lb/>
is almost ready to break forth in Thebes,<lb/>
and Capaneus shall be invincible<lb/>
to all save the strong hand of Jove himself;<lb/>
and there two hostile brothers shall engage<lb/>
in bloody conflict; and Amphiaraus<lb/>
shall see his own ghost, deep in yawning earth.<lb/>

    
“His own son, dutiful to him, shall be<lb/>
both just and unjust in a single deed;<lb/>
for he, in vengeance for his father's death,<lb/>
shall slay his mother, and confounded lose<lb/>
both home and reason,—persecuted both<lb/>
by the grim Furies and the awful ghost<lb/>
of his own murdered mother; this until<lb/>
his wife, deluded, shall request of him<lb/>
the fatal golden necklace, and until<lb/>
the sword of Phegeus drains his kinsman's blood.<lb/>

    
“And then at last his wife Callirhoe<lb/>
shall supplicate the mighty Jupiter<lb/>
to grant her infant sons the added years<lb/>
of youthful manhood. Then shall Jupiter<lb/>
let Hebe, guardian of ungathered days,<lb/>
grant from the future to Callirhoe's sons,<lb/>
the strength of manhood in their infancy.<lb/>
Do not let their victorious father's death<lb/>
be unavenged a long while. Jove prevailed<lb/>
upon, will claim beforehand all the gifts<lb/>
of Hebe, who is his known daughter-in-law,<lb/>
and his step-daughter, and with one act change<lb/>
Callirhoe's beardless boys to men of size.”<lb/>


Byblis.

When Themis, prophesying future days,<lb/>
had said these words, the Gods of Heaven complained<lb/>
because they also could not grant the gift<lb/>
of youth to many others in this way.<lb/>
Aurora wept because her husband had<lb/>
white hair; and Ceres then bewailed the age<lb/>
of her Iasion, grey and stricken old;<lb/>
and Mulciber demanded with new life<lb/>
his Erichthonius might again appear;<lb/>
and Venus, thinking upon future days,<lb/>
said old Anchises' years must be restored.<lb/>

    
And every god preferred some favorite,<lb/>
until vexed with the clamor, Jupiter<lb/>
implored, “If you can have regard for me,<lb/>
consider the strange blessings you desire:<lb/>
does any one of you believe he can<lb/>
prevail against the settled will of Fate?<lb/>
As Iolaus has returned by fate,<lb/>
to those years spent by him; so by the Fates<lb/>
Callirhoe's sons from infancy must grow<lb/>
to manhood with no struggle on their part,<lb/>
or force of their ambition. And you should<lb/>
endure your fortune with contented minds:<lb/>
I, also, must give all control to Fate.<lb/>

    
“If I had power to change the course of Fate<lb/>
I would not let advancing age break down<lb/>
my own son Aeacus, nor bend his back<lb/>
with weight of year; and Rhadamanthus should<lb/>
retain an everlasting flower of youth,<lb/>
together with my own son Minos, who<lb/>
is now despised because of his great age,<lb/>
so that his scepter has lost dignity.”<lb/>

    
Such words of Jupiter controlled the Gods,<lb/>
and none continued to complain, when they<lb/>
saw Aeacus and Rhadamanthus old,<lb/>
and Minos also, weary of his age.<lb/>
And they remembered Minos in his prime,<lb/>
had warred against great nations, till his name<lb/>
if mentioned was a certain cause of fear.<lb/>
But now, enfeebled by great age, he feared<lb/>
Miletus, Deione's son, because<lb/>
of his exultant youth and strength derived<lb/>
from his great father Phoebus. And although<lb/>
he well perceived Miletus' eye was fixed<lb/>
upon his throne, he did not dare to drive<lb/>
him from his kingdom.<lb/>

    
But although not forced,<lb/>
Miletus of his own accord did fly,<lb/>
by swift ship, over to the Asian shore,<lb/>
across the Aegean water, where he built<lb/>
the city of his name.<lb/>

BYBLIS AND CAUNUS

Cyane, who<lb/>
was known to be the daughter of the stream<lb/>
Maeander, which with many a twist and turn<lb/>
flows wandering there—Cyane said to be<lb/>
indeed most beautiful, when known by him,<lb/>
gave birth to two; a girl called Byblis, who<lb/>
was lovely, and the brother Caunus—twins.<lb/>

    
Byblis is an example that the love<lb/>
of every maiden must be within law.<lb/>
Seized with a passion for her brother, she<lb/>
loved him, descendant of Apollo, not<lb/>
as sister loves a brother; not in such<lb/>
a manner as the law of man permits.<lb/>

    
At first she thought it surely was not wrong<lb/>
to kiss him passionately, while her arms<lb/>
were thrown around her brother's neck, and so<lb/>
deceived herself. And, as the habit grew,<lb/>
her sister-love degenerated, till<lb/>
richly attired, she came to see her brother,<lb/>
with all endeavors to attract his eye;<lb/>
and anxious to be seen most beautiful,<lb/>
she envied every woman who appeared<lb/>
of rival beauty. But she did not know<lb/>
or understand the flame, hot in her heart,<lb/>
though she was agitated when she saw<lb/>
the object of her swiftly growing love.<lb/>

    
Now she began to call him lord, and now<lb/>
she hated to say brother, and she said,<lb/>
“Do call me Byblis—never call me sister!”<lb/>
And yet while feeling love so, when awake<lb/>
she does not dwell upon impure desire;<lb/>
but when dissolved in the soft arms of sleep,<lb/>
she sees the very object of her love,<lb/>
and blushing, dreams she is embraced by him,<lb/>
till slumber has departed. For a time<lb/>
she lies there silent, as her mind recalls<lb/>
the loved appearance of her lovely dream,<lb/>
until her wavering heart, in grief exclaims:—<lb/>

    
“What is this vision of the silent night?<lb/>
Ah wretched me! I cannot count it true.<lb/>
And, if he were not my own brother, he<lb/>
why is my fond heart tortured with this dream?<lb/>
He is so handsome even to envious eyes,<lb/>
it is not strange he has filled my fond heart;<lb/>
so surely would be worthy of my love.<lb/>
But it is my misfortune I am his<lb/>
own sister. Let me therefore strive, awake,<lb/>
to stand with honor, but let sleep return<lb/>
the same dream often to me.—There can be<lb/>
no fear of any witness to a shade<lb/>
which phantoms my delight.—O Cupid, swift<lb/>
of love-wing with your mother, and O my<lb/>
beloved Venus! wonderful the joys<lb/>
of my experience in the transport. All<lb/>
as if reality sustaining, lifted me<lb/>
up to elysian pleasure, while in truth<lb/>
I lay dissolving to my very marrow:<lb/>
the pleasure was so brief, and Night, headlong<lb/>
sped from me, envious of my coming joys.<lb/>

    
“If I could change my name, and join to you,<lb/>
how good a daughter I would prove to your<lb/>
dear father, and how good a son would you<lb/>
be to my father. If the Gods agreed,<lb/>
then everything would be possessed by us<lb/>
in common, but this must exclude ancestors.<lb/>
For I should pray, compared with mine yours might<lb/>
be quite superior. But, oh my love,<lb/>
some other woman by your love will be<lb/>
a mother; but because, unfortunate,<lb/>
my parents are the same as yours, you must<lb/>
be nothing but a brother. Sorrows, then,<lb/>
shall be to us in common from this hour.<lb/>
What have my night-born vision signified?<lb/>
What weight have dreams? Do dreams have any weight?<lb/>
The Gods forbid! The Gods have sisters! Truth<lb/>
declares even Saturn married Ops, his own<lb/>
blood-kin, Oceanus his Tethys, Jove,<lb/>
Olympian his Juno. But the Gods<lb/>
are so superior in their laws, I should<lb/>
not measure human custom by the rights<lb/>
established in the actions of divinities.<lb/>
This passion must be banished from my heart,<lb/>
or, if it cannot be so, I must pray<lb/>
that I may perish, and be laid out dead<lb/>
upon my couch so my dear brother there<lb/>
may kiss my lips. But then he must consent,<lb/>
and my delight would seem to him a crime.<lb/>

    
“Tis known the sons of Aeolus embraced<lb/>
their sisters —But why should I think of these?<lb/>
Why should I take example from such lives?<lb/>
Must I do as they did? Far from it! let<lb/>
such lawless flames be quenched, until I feel<lb/>
no evil love for him, although the pure<lb/>
affection of a sister may be mine,<lb/>
and cherished. If it should have happened first<lb/>
that my dear brother had loved me—ah then,<lb/>
I might have yielded love to his desire.<lb/>
Why not now? I myself must woo him, since<lb/>
I could not have rejected him, if he<lb/>
had first wooed me. But is it possible<lb/>
for me to speak of it, with proper words<lb/>
describing such a strange confession? Love<lb/>
will certainly compel and give me speech.<lb/>
But, if shame seal my lips, then secret flame<lb/>
in a sealed letter may be safely told.”<lb/>


    
And after all this wavering, her mind<lb/>
at last was satisfied; and as she leaned<lb/>
on her left elbow, partly raised from her<lb/>
half-dream position, she said, “Let him see:<lb/>
let me at once confess my frantic passion<lb/>
without repression! O my wretched heart!<lb/>
What hot flame burns me!” But while speaking so,<lb/>
she took an iron pen in her right hand,<lb/>
and trembling wrote the heart-words as she could,<lb/>
all on a clean wax tablet which she held<lb/>
in her limp left hand. She begins and stops,<lb/>
and hesitates—she loves and hates her hot<lb/>
confession—writes, erases, changes here<lb/>
and there, condemns, approves, disheartened throws<lb/>
her tablets down and takes them up again:<lb/>
her mind refuses everything she does,<lb/>
and moves against each action as begun:<lb/>
shame, fear and bold assurance mingled showed<lb/>
upon her face, as she began to write,<lb/>
“Your sister” but at once decided she<lb/>
could not say sister, and commenced instead,<lb/>
with other words on her amended wax.<lb/>

    
“A health to you, which she who loves you fails<lb/>
to have, unless you grant the same to her.<lb/>
It shames me, oh I am ashamed to tell<lb/>
my name to you, and so without my name,<lb/>
I would I might plead well until the hopes<lb/>
of my desires were realized, and then<lb/>
you might know safely, Byblis is my name.<lb/>

    
“You might have knowledge of my wounded heart,<lb/>
because my pale, drawn face and down-cast eyes<lb/>
so often tearful, and my sighs without<lb/>
apparent cause have shown it — and my warm<lb/>
embraces, and my frequent kisses, much<lb/>
too tender for a sister. All of this<lb/>
has happened, while with agitated heart<lb/>
and in hot passion, I have tried all ways,<lb/>
(I call upon the Gods to witness it!)<lb/>
that I might force myself to sanity.<lb/>
And I have struggled, wretched nights and days,<lb/>
to overcome the cruelties of love,<lb/>
too dreadful for a frail girl to endure,<lb/>
for they most surely are all Cupid's art.<lb/>

    
“I have been overborne and must confess<lb/>
my passion, while with timid prayers I plead;<lb/>
for only you can save me. You alone<lb/>
may now destroy the one who loves you best:<lb/>
so you must choose what will be the result.<lb/>
The one who prays is not your enemy;<lb/>
but one most closely joined to you, yet asks<lb/>
to knit the tie more firmly. Let old men<lb/>
be governed by propriety, and talk<lb/>
of what is right and wrong, and hold to all<lb/>
the nice distinctions of strict laws. But Love,<lb/>
has no fixed law for those whose age is ours,<lb/>
is heedless and compliant. And we have<lb/>
not yet discovered what is right or wrong,<lb/>
and all we should do is to imitate<lb/>
the known example of the Gods. We have<lb/>
no father's harsh rule, and we have no care<lb/>
for reputation, and no fear that keeps<lb/>
us from each other. But there may be cause<lb/>
for fear, and we may hide our stolen love,<lb/>
because a sister is at liberty<lb/>
to talk with her dear brother—quite apart:<lb/>
we may embrace and kiss each other, though<lb/>
in public. What is wanting? Pity her<lb/>
whose utmost love compels her to confess;<lb/>
and let it not be written on her tomb,<lb/>
her death was for your sake and love denied.”<lb/>

    
Here when she dropped the tablet from her hand,<lb/>
it was so full of fond words, which were doomed<lb/>
to disappointment, that the last line traced<lb/>
the edge: and without thinking of delay,<lb/>
she stamped the shameful letter with her seal,<lb/>
and moistened it with tears (her tongue failed her<lb/>
for moisture). Then, hot-blushing, she called one<lb/>
of her attendants, and with timid voice<lb/>
said, coaxing, “My most trusted servant, take<lb/>
these tablets to my—” after long delay<lb/>
she said, “my brother.” While she gave the tablets<lb/>
they suddenly slipped from her hands and fell.<lb/>

    
Although disturbed by this bad omen, she<lb/>
still sent the letter, which the servant found<lb/>
an opportunity to carry off.<lb/>
He gave the secret love-confession. This<lb/>
her brother, grandson of Maeander, read<lb/>
but partly, and with sudden passion threw<lb/>
the tablets from him. He could barely hold<lb/>
himself from clutching on the throat of her<lb/>
fear-trembling servant; as, enraged, he cried,<lb/>
“Accursed pander to forbidden lust,<lb/>
be gone!—before the knowledge of your death<lb/>
is added to this unforeseen disgrace!”<lb/>

    
The servant fled in terror, and told all<lb/>
her brother's actions and his fierce reply<lb/>
to Byblis: and when she had heard her love<lb/>
had been repulsed, her startled face went pale,<lb/>
and her whole body trembled in the grip<lb/>
of ice-chills. Quickly as her mind regained<lb/>
its usual strength, her maddening love returned,<lb/>
came back with equal force, and while she choked<lb/>
with her emotion, gasping she said this:<lb/>

    
“I suffer only from my folly! why did I<lb/>
so rashly tell him of my wounded heart?<lb/>
And why did I so hastily commit<lb/>
to tablets all I should have kept concealed?<lb/>
I should have edged my way by feeling first,<lb/>
obscurely hinting till I knew his mind<lb/>
and disposition towards me. And so that<lb/>
my first voyage might get favorable wind,<lb/>
I should have tested with a close-reefed sail,<lb/>
and, knowing what the wind was, safely fared.<lb/>
But now with sails full spread I have been tossed<lb/>
by unexpected winds. And so my ship<lb/>
is on the rocks; and, overwhelmed with all<lb/>
the power of Ocean, I have not the strength<lb/>
to turn back and recover what is lost.<lb/>

    
“Surely clear omens warned me not to tell<lb/>
my love so soon, because the tablets fell<lb/>
just when I would have put them in the hand<lb/>
of my picked servant — certainly a sign<lb/>
my hasty hopes were destined to fall down.<lb/>
Is it not clear I should have changed the day;<lb/>
and even my intention? Rather say<lb/>
should not the day have been postponed at once?<lb/>
The god himself gave me unerring signs,<lb/>
if I had not been so deranged with love.<lb/>
I should have spoken to him, face to face;<lb/>
and with my own lips have confessed it all;<lb/>
and then my passion had been seen by him,<lb/>
and, as my face was bathed in tears, I could<lb/>
have told him so much more than words engraved<lb/>
on tablets; and, while I was telling him<lb/>
I could have thrown my arms around his neck,<lb/>
and if rejected could have seemed almost<lb/>
at point of death; as I embraced his feet,<lb/>
while prostrate, even might have begged for life.<lb/>
I could have tried so many plans, and they<lb/>
together would have won his stubborn heart.<lb/>

    
“Perhaps my stupid servant, in mistake,<lb/>
did not approach him at a proper time,<lb/>
and even sought an hour his mind was full<lb/>
of other things.<lb/>

    
“All this has harmed my case;<lb/>
there is no other reason; he was not<lb/>
born of a tigress, and his heart is not<lb/>
of flint or solid iron, or of adamant;<lb/>
and no she-lion suckled him. He shall<lb/>
be won to my affection; and I must<lb/>
attempt again, again, nor ever cease<lb/>
so long as I have breath. If it were not<lb/>
too late already to undo what has<lb/>
been done, 'twere wiser not begun at all.<lb/>
But since I have begun, it now is best<lb/>
to end it with success. How can he help<lb/>
remembering what I dared, although I should<lb/>
abandon my design! In such a case,<lb/>
because I gave up, I must be to him<lb/>
weak, fickle-minded; or perhaps he may<lb/>
believe I tried to tempt him with a snare.<lb/>
But come what may, he will not think of me<lb/>
as overcome by some god who inflames<lb/>
and rules the heart. He surely will believe<lb/>
I was so actuated by my lust.<lb/>

    
“If I do nothing more, my innocence<lb/>
is gone forever. I have written him<lb/>
and wooed him also, in a way so rash<lb/>
and unmistakable, that if I should<lb/>
do nothing more than this, I should be held<lb/>
completely guilty in my brother's sight—<lb/>
but I have hope, and nothing worse to fear.”<lb/>


    
Then back and forth she argues; and so great<lb/>
is her uncertainty, she blames herself<lb/>
for what she did, and is determined just<lb/>
as surely to succeed.<lb/>

    
She tries all arts,<lb/>
but is repeatedly repulsed by him,<lb/>
until unable to control her ways,<lb/>
her brother in despair, fled from the shame<lb/>
of her designs: and in another land<lb/>
he founded a new city.<lb/>

    
Then, they say,<lb/>
the wretched daughter of Miletus lost<lb/>
control of reason. She wrenched from her breast<lb/>
her garments, and quite frantic, beat her arms,<lb/>
and publicly proclaims unhallowed love.<lb/>
Grown desperate, she left her hated home,<lb/>
her native land, and followed the loved steps<lb/>
of her departed brother. Just as those<lb/>
crazed by your thyrsus, son of Semele!<lb/>
The Bacchanals of Ismarus, aroused,<lb/>
howl at your orgies, so her shrieks were heard<lb/>
by the shocked women of Bubassus, where<lb/>
the frenzied Byblis howled across the fields,<lb/>
and so through Caria and through Lycia,<lb/>
over the mountain Cragus and beyond<lb/>
the town, Lymira, and the flowing stream<lb/>
called Xanthus, and the ridge where dwelt<lb/>
Chimaera, serpent-tailed and monstrous beast,<lb/>
fire breathing from its lion head and neck.<lb/>

    
She hurried through the forest of that ridge—<lb/>
and there at last worn out with your pursuit,<lb/>
O Byblis, you fell prostrate, with your hair<lb/>
spread over the hard ground, and your wan face<lb/>
buried in fallen leaves. Although the young,<lb/>
still tender-hearted nymphs of Leleges,<lb/>
advised her fondly how to cure her love,<lb/>
and offered comfort to her heedless heart,<lb/>
and even lifted her in their soft arms;<lb/>
without an answer Byblis fell from them,<lb/>
and clutched the green herbs with her fingers, while<lb/>
her tears continued to fall on the grass.<lb/>
They say the weeping Naiads gave to her<lb/>
a vein of tears which always flows there from<lb/>
her sorrows—nothing better could be done.<lb/>

    
Immediately, as drops of pitch drip forth<lb/>
from the gashed pine, or sticky bitumen<lb/>
distils out from the rich and heavy earth,<lb/>
or as the frozen water at the approach<lb/>
of a soft-breathing wind melts in the sun;<lb/>
so Byblis, sad descendant of the Sun,<lb/>
dissolving in her own tears, was there changed<lb/>
into a fountain; which to this late day,<lb/>
in all those valleys has no name but hers,<lb/>
and issues underneath a dark oak-tree.<lb/>


Iphis.
IPHIS AND IANTHE

The tale of this unholy passion would<lb/>
perhaps, have filled Crete's hundred cities then,<lb/>
if Crete had not a wonder of its own<lb/>
to talk of, in the change of Iphis. Once,<lb/>
there lived at Phaestus, not far from the town<lb/>
of Gnossus, a man Ligdus, not well known;<lb/>
in fact obscure, of humble parentage,<lb/>
whose income was no greater than his birth;<lb/>
but he was held trustworthy and his life<lb/>
had been quite blameless. When the time drew near<lb/>
his wife should give birth to a child, he warned<lb/>
her and instructed her, with words we quote:—<lb/>

    
“There are two things which I would ask of Heaven:<lb/>
that you may be delivered with small pain,<lb/>
and that your child may surely be a boy.<lb/>
Girls are such trouble, fair strength is denied<lb/>
to them.—Therefore (may Heaven refuse the thought)<lb/>
if chance should cause your child to be a girl,<lb/>
(gods pardon me for having said the word!)<lb/>
we must agree to have her put to death.”<lb/>

    
And all the time he spoke such dreaded words,<lb/>
their faces were completely bathed in tears;<lb/>
not only hers but also his while he<lb/>
forced on her that unnatural command.<lb/>
Ah, Telethusa ceaselessly implored<lb/>
her husband to give way to fortune's cast;<lb/>
but Ligdus held his resolution fixed.<lb/>

    
And now the expected time of birth was near,<lb/>
when in the middle of the night she seemed<lb/>
to see the goddess Isis, standing by<lb/>
her bed, in company of serious spirit forms;<lb/>
Isis had crescent horns upon her forehead,<lb/>
and a bright garland made of golden grain<lb/>
encircled her fair brow. It was a crown<lb/>
of regal beauty: and beside her stood<lb/>
the dog Anubis, and Bubastis, there<lb/>
the sacred, dappled Apis, and the God<lb/>
of silence with pressed finger on his lips;<lb/>
the sacred rattles were there, and Osiris, known<lb/>
the constant object of his worshippers' desire,<lb/>
and there the Egyptian serpent whose quick sting<lb/>
gives long-enduring sleep. She seemed to see<lb/>
them all, and even to hear the goddess say<lb/>
to her, “O Telethusa, one of my<lb/>
remembered worshippers, forget your grief;<lb/>
your husband's orders need not be obeyed;<lb/>
and when Lucina has delivered you,<lb/>
save and bring up your child, if either boy<lb/>
or girl. I am the goddess who brings help<lb/>
to all who call upon me; and you shall<lb/>
never complain of me—that you adored<lb/>
a thankless deity.” So she advised<lb/>
by vision the sad mother, and left her.<lb/>

    
The Cretan woman joyfully arose<lb/>
from her sad bed, and supplicating, raised<lb/>
ecstatic hands up towards the listening stars,<lb/>
and prayed to them her vision might come true.<lb/>

    
Soon, when her pains gave birth, the mother knew<lb/>
her infant was a girl (the father had<lb/>
no knowledge of it, as he was not there).<lb/>
Intending to deceive, the mother said,<lb/>
“Feed the dear boy.” All things had favored her<lb/>
deceit—no one except the trusted nurse,<lb/>
knew of it. And the father paid his vows,<lb/>
and named the child after its grandfather, whose<lb/>
name was honored Iphis. Hearing it so called,<lb/>
the mother could not but rejoice, because<lb/>
her child was given a name of common gender,<lb/>
and she could use it with no more deceit.<lb/>

    
She took good care to dress it as a boy,<lb/>
and either as a boy or girl, its face<lb/>
must always be accounted lovable.<lb/>

    
And so she grew,—ten years and three had gone,<lb/>
and then your father found a bride for you<lb/>
O Iphis—promised you should take to wife<lb/>
the golden-haired Ianthe, praised by all<lb/>
the women of Phaestus for the dower<lb/>
of her unequalled beauty, and well known,<lb/>
the daughter of a Cretan named Telestes.<lb/>
Of equal age and equal loveliness,<lb/>
they had received from the same teachers, all<lb/>
instruction in their childish rudiments.<lb/>
So unsuspected love had filled their hearts<lb/>
with equal longing—but how different!<lb/>

    
Ianthe waits in confidence and hope<lb/>
the ceremonial as agreed upon,<lb/>
and is quite certain she will wed a man.<lb/>
But Iphis is in love without one hope<lb/>
of passion's ecstasy, the thought of which<lb/>
only increased her flame; and she a girl<lb/>
is burnt with passion for another girl!<lb/>
She hardly can hold back her tears, and says:<lb/>

    
“O what will be the awful dreaded end,<lb/>
with such a monstrous love compelling me?<lb/>
If the Gods should wish to save me, certainly<lb/>
they should have saved me; but, if their desire<lb/>
was for my ruin, still they should have given<lb/>

    
some natural suffering of humanity.<lb/>
The passion for a cow does not inflame a cow,<lb/>
no mare has ever sought another mare.<lb/>
The ram inflames the ewe, and every doe<lb/>
follows a chosen stag; so also birds<lb/>
are mated, and in all the animal world<lb/>
no female ever feels love passion for<lb/>
another female—why is it in me?<lb/>

    
“Monstrosities are natural to Crete,<lb/>
the daughter of the Sun there loved a bull—<lb/>
it was a female's mad love for the male—<lb/>
but my desire is far more mad than hers,<lb/>
in strict regard of truth, for she had hope<lb/>
of love's fulfillment. She secured the bull<lb/>
by changing herself to a heifer's form;<lb/>
and in that subtlety it was the male<lb/>
deceived at last. Though all the subtleties<lb/>
of all the world should be collected here;—<lb/>
if Daedalus himself should fly back here<lb/>
upon his waxen wings, what could he do?<lb/>
What skillful art of his could change my sex,<lb/>
a girl into a boy—or could he change<lb/>
Ianthe? What a useless thought! Be bold<lb/>
take courage Iphis, and be strong of soul.<lb/>
This hopeless passion stultifies your heart;<lb/>
so shake it off, and hold your memory<lb/>
down to the clear fact of your birth: unless<lb/>
your will provides deception for yourself:<lb/>
do only what is lawful, and confine<lb/>
strictly, your love within a woman's right.<lb/>

    
“Hope of fulfillment can beget true love,<lb/>
and hope keeps it alive. You are deprived<lb/>
of this hope by the nature of your birth.<lb/>
No guardian keeps you from her dear embrace,<lb/>
no watchful jealous husband, and she has<lb/>
no cruel father: she does not deny<lb/>
herself to you. With all that liberty,<lb/>
you can not have her for your happy wife,<lb/>
though Gods and men should labor for your wish.<lb/>
None of my prayers has ever been denied;<lb/>
the willing Deities have granted me<lb/>
whatever should be, and my father helps<lb/>
me to accomplish everything I plan:<lb/>
she and her father also, always help.<lb/>
But Nature is more powerful than all,<lb/>
and only Nature works for my distress.<lb/>

    
“The wedding-day already is at hand;<lb/>
the longed-for time is come; Ianthe soon<lb/>
will be mine only—and yet, not my own:<lb/>
with water all around me I shall thirst!<lb/>
O why must Juno, goddess of sweet brides,<lb/>
and why should Hymen also, favor us<lb/>
when man with woman cannot join in wedlock,<lb/>
but both are brides?” And so she closed her lips.<lb/>


    
The other maiden flamed with equal love,<lb/>
and often prayed for Hymen to appear.<lb/>
But Telethusa, fearing that event,<lb/>
the marriage which Ianthe keenly sought,<lb/>
procrastinated, causing first delay<lb/>
by some pretended illness; and then gave<lb/>
pretence of omens and of visions seen,<lb/>
sufficient for delay, until she had<lb/>
exhausted every avenue of excuse,<lb/>
and only one more day remained before<lb/>
the fateful time, it was so near at hand.<lb/>

    
Despairing then of finding other cause<lb/>
which might prevent the fated wedding-day,<lb/>
the mother took the circled fillets from<lb/>
her own head, and her daughter's head, and prayed,<lb/>
as she embraced the altar—her long hair<lb/>
spread out upon the flowing breeze—and said:<lb/>

    
“O Isis, goddess of Paraetonium,<lb/>
the Mareotic fields, Pharos, and Nile<lb/>
of seven horns divided—oh give help!<lb/>
Goddess of nations! heal us of our fears!<lb/>
I saw you, goddess, and your symbols once,<lb/>
and I adored them all, the clashing sounds<lb/>
of sistra and the torches of your train,<lb/>
and I took careful note of your commands,<lb/>
for which my daughter lives to see the sun,<lb/>
and also I have so escaped from harm;—<lb/>
all this is of your counsel and your gift;<lb/>
oh, pity both of us—and give us aid!”<lb/>

    
Tears emphasized her prayer; the goddess seemed<lb/>
to move—in truth it was the altar moved;<lb/>
the firm doors of the temple even shook—<lb/>
and her horns, crescent, flashed with gleams of light,<lb/>
and her loud sistrum rattled noisily.<lb/>
Although not quite free of all fear, yet pleased<lb/>
by that good omen, gladly the mother left<lb/>
the temple with her daughter Iphis, who<lb/>
beside her walked, but with a lengthened stride.<lb/>

    
Her face seemed of a darker hue, her strength<lb/>
seemed greater, and her features were more stern.<lb/>
Her hair once long, was unadorned and short.<lb/>
There is more vigor in her than she showed<lb/>
in her girl ways. For in the name of truth,<lb/>
Iphis, who was a girl, is now a man!<lb/>
Make offerings at the temple and rejoice<lb/>
without a fear!—They offer at the shrines,<lb/>
and add a votive tablet, on which this<lb/>
inscription is engraved:<lb/>

    
these gifts are paid<lb/>
by Iphis as a man which as a maid<lb/>
he vowed to give.<lb/>

    
The morrow's dawn<lb/>
revealed the wide world; on the day agreed,<lb/>
Venus, Juno and Hymen, all have met<lb/>
our happy lovers at the marriage fires; <lb/>

    
and Iphis, a new man, gained his Ianthe.<lb/>

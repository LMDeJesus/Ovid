Scylla et Circe.
SCYLLA TRANSFORMED TO A ROCK

Now the Euboean dweller in great waves,<lb/>
Glaucus, had left behind the crest of Aetna,<lb/>
raised upward from a giant's head; and left<lb/>
the Cyclops' fields, that never had been torn<lb/>
by harrow or by plough and never were<lb/>
indebted to the toil of oxen yoked;<lb/>
left Zancle, also, and the opposite walls<lb/>
of Rhegium, and the sea, abundant cause<lb/>
of shipwreck, which confined with double shores<lb/>
bounds the Ausonian and Sicilian lands.<lb/>

    
All these behind him, Glaucus, swimming on<lb/>
with his huge hands through those Tyrrhenian seas,<lb/>
drew near the hills so rich in magic herbs<lb/>
and halls of Circe, daughter of the Sun,—<lb/>
halls filled with men in guise of animals.<lb/>
After due salutations had been given—<lb/>
received by her as kindly—Glaucus said,<lb/>

    
“You as a goddess, certainly should have<lb/>
compassion upon me, a god; for you<lb/>
alone (if I am worthy of it) can<lb/>
relieve my passion. What the power of herbs<lb/>
can be, Titania, none knows more than I,<lb/>
for by their power I was myself transformed.<lb/>
To make the cause of my strange madness known,<lb/>
I have found Scylla on Italian shores,<lb/>
directly opposite Messenian walls.<lb/>

    
“It shames me to recount my promises,<lb/>
entreaties, and caresses, and at last<lb/>
rejection of my suit. If you have known<lb/>
a power of incantation, I implore<lb/>
you now repeat that incantation here,<lb/>
with sacred lips—If herbs have greater power,<lb/>
use the tried power of herbs. But I would not<lb/>
request a cure—the healing of this wound.<lb/>
Much better than an end of pain, let her<lb/>
share, and feel with me my impassioned flame.”<lb/>

    
But Circe was more quick than any other<lb/>
to burn with passion's flame. It may have been<lb/>
her nature or it may have been the work<lb/>
of Venus, angry at her tattling sire.<lb/>

    
“You might do better,” she replied, “to court<lb/>
one who is willing, one who wants your love,<lb/>
and feels a like desire. You did deserve<lb/>
to win her love, yes, to be wooed yourself.<lb/>
In fact you might be. If you give some hope,<lb/>
you have my word, you shall indeed be wooed.<lb/>
That you may have no doubt, and so retain<lb/>
all confidence in your attraction's power—<lb/>
behold! I am a goddess, and I am<lb/>
the daughter also, of the radiant Sun!<lb/>
And I who am so potent with my charms,<lb/>
and I who am so potent with my herbs,<lb/>
wish only to be yours. Despise her who<lb/>
despises you, and her who is attached<lb/>
to you repay with like attachment—so<lb/>
by one act offer each her just reward.”<lb/>

    
But Glaucus answered her attempt of love,<lb/>
“The trees will sooner grow in ocean waves,<lb/>
the sea-weed sooner grow on mountain tops,<lb/>
than I shall change my love for graceful! Scylla.”<lb/>

    
The goddess in her jealous rage could not<lb/>
and would not injure him, whom she still loved,<lb/>
but turned her wrath upon the one preferred.<lb/>
She bruised immediately the many herbs<lb/>
most infamous for horrid juices, which,<lb/>
when bruised, she mingled with most artful care<lb/>
and incantations given by Hecate.<lb/>
Then, clothed in azure vestments, she passed through<lb/>
her troop of fawning savage animals,<lb/>
and issued from the center of her hall.<lb/>
Pacing from there to Rhegium, opposite<lb/>
the dangerous rocks of Zancle, she at once<lb/>
entered the tossed waves boiling up with tides:<lb/>
on these as if she walked on the firm shore,<lb/>
she set her feet and, hastening on dry shod,<lb/>
she skimmed along the surface of the deep.<lb/>

    
Not far away there was an inlet curved,<lb/>
round as a bent bow, which was often used<lb/>
by Scylla as a favorite retreat.<lb/>
There, she withdrew from heat of sea and sky<lb/>
when in the zenith blazed the unclouded sun<lb/>
and cast the shortest shadows on the ground.<lb/>
Circe infected it before that hour,<lb/>

    
polluting it with monster-breeding drugs.<lb/>
She sprinkled juices over it, distilled<lb/>
from an obnoxious root, and thrice times nine<lb/>
she muttered over it with magic lips,<lb/>
her most mysterious charm involved in words<lb/>
of strangest import and of dubious thought.<lb/>

    
Scylla came there and waded in waist deep,<lb/>
then saw her loins defiled with barking shapes.<lb/>
Believing they could be no part of her,<lb/>
she ran and tried to drive them back and feared<lb/>
the boisterous canine jaws. But what she fled<lb/>
she carried with her. And, feeling for her thighs,<lb/>
her legs, and feet, she found Cerberian jaws<lb/>
instead. She rises from a rage of dogs,<lb/>
and shaggy backs encircle her shortened loins.<lb/>

    
The lover Glaucus wept. He fled the embrace<lb/>
of Circe and her hostile power of herbs<lb/>
and magic spells. But Scylla did not leave<lb/>
the place of her disaster; and, as soon<lb/>
as she had opportunity, for hate<lb/>
of Circe, she robbed Ulysses of his men.<lb/>
She would have wrecked the Trojan ships, if she<lb/>
had not been changed beforehand to a rock<lb/>
which to this day reveals a craggy rim.<lb/>
And even the rock awakes the sailors' dread.<lb/>


Cercopes.
THE CERCOPES TRANSFORMED TO APES

After the Trojan ships, pushed by their oars,<lb/>
had safely passed by Scylla and the fierce<lb/>
Charybdis, and with care had then approached<lb/>
near the Ausonian shore, a roaring gale<lb/>
bore them far southward to the Libyan coast.<lb/>

    
And then Sidonian Dido, who was doomed<lb/>
not calmly to endure the loss of her<lb/>
loved Phrygian husband, graciously received<lb/>
Aeneas to her home and her regard:<lb/>
and on a pyre, erected with pretense<lb/>
of holy rites, she fell upon the sword.<lb/>
Deceived herself, she there deceived them all.<lb/>

    
Aeneas, fleeing the new walls built on<lb/>
that sandy shore, revisited the land<lb/>
of Eryx and Acestes, his true friend.<lb/>
There he performed a hallowed sacrifice<lb/>
and paid due honor to his father's tomb.<lb/>
And presently he loosened from that shore<lb/>
the ships which Iris, Juno's minister,<lb/>
had almost burned; and sailing, passed far off<lb/>
the kingdom of the son of Hippotas,<lb/>
in those hot regions smoking with the fumes<lb/>
of burning sulphur, and he left behind<lb/>
the rocky haunt of Achelous' daughters,<lb/>
the Sirens. Then, when his good ship had lost<lb/>
the pilot, he coasted near Inarime,<lb/>
near Prochyta, and near the barren hill<lb/>
which marks another island, Pithecusae,<lb/>
an island named from strange inhabitants.<lb/>

    
The father of the gods abhorred the frauds<lb/>
and perjuries of the Cercopians<lb/>
and for the crimes of that bad treacherous race,<lb/>
transformed its men to ugly animals,<lb/>
appearing unlike men, although like men.<lb/>
He had contracted and had bent their limbs,<lb/>
and flattened out their noses, bent back towards<lb/>
their foreheads; he had furrowed every face<lb/>
with wrinkles of old age, and made them live<lb/>
in that spot, after he had covered all<lb/>
their bodies with long yellow ugly hair.<lb/>
Besides all that, he took away from them<lb/>
the use of language and control of tongues,<lb/>
so long inclined to dreadful perjury;<lb/>
and left them always to complain of life<lb/>
and their ill conduct in harsh jabbering.<lb/>


Sibylla.
THE SIBYL BECOMES GRAY AND DECREPIT

After Aeneas had passed by all those<lb/>
and seen to his right hand the distant walls<lb/>
guarding the city of Parthenope,<lb/>
he passed on his left hand a mound,<lb/>
grave of the tuneful son of Aeolus.<lb/>
Landing on Cumae's marshy shore, he reached<lb/>
a cavern, home of the long lived Sibylla,<lb/>
and prayed that she would give him at the lake,<lb/>
Avernus, access to his father's shade.<lb/>

    
She raised her countenance, from gazing on<lb/>
the ground, and with an inspiration given<lb/>
to her by influence of the god, she said,<lb/>
“Much you would have, O man of famous deeds,<lb/>
whose courage is attested by the sword,<lb/>
whose filial piety is proved by flame.<lb/>
But, Trojan, have no fear. I grant your wish,<lb/>
and with my guidance you shall look upon<lb/>
the latest kingdom of the world, shall see<lb/>
Elysian homes and your dear father's shade,<lb/>
for virtue there is everywhere a way.”<lb/>

    
She spoke, and pointed out to him a branch<lb/>
refulgent with bright gold, found in the woods<lb/>
of Juno of Avernus, and commanded him<lb/>
to pluck it from the stem. Aeneas did<lb/>
what she advised him. Then he saw the wealth<lb/>
of the dread Orcus, and he saw his own<lb/>
ancestors, and beheld the aged ghost<lb/>
of great Anchises. There he learned the laws<lb/>
of that deep region, and what dangers must<lb/>
be undergone by him in future wars.<lb/>

    
Retracing with his weary steps the path<lb/>
up to the light, he found relief from toil<lb/>
in converse with the sage Cumaean guide.<lb/>
While in thick dusk he trod the frightful way,<lb/>
“Whether you are a deity,” he said,<lb/>
“Or human and most favored by the gods,<lb/>
to me you always will appear divine.<lb/>
I will confess, too, my existence here<lb/>
is due to your kind aid, for by your will<lb/>
I visited the dark abodes of death,<lb/>
and I escaped the death which I beheld.<lb/>
For this great service, when I shall emerge<lb/>
into the sunlit air, I will erect<lb/>
for you a temple and will burn for you<lb/>
sweet incense kindled at the altar flame.”<lb/>

    
The prophetess looked on him and with sighs,<lb/>
“I am no goddess,” she replied, “nor is<lb/>
it well to honor any mortal head<lb/>
with tribute of the holy frankincense.<lb/>
And, that you may not err through ignorance,<lb/>
I tell you life eternal without end<lb/>
was;offered to me, if I would but yield<lb/>
virginity to Phoebus for his love.<lb/>
And, while he hoped for this and in desire<lb/>
offered to bribe me for my virtue, first<lb/>
with gifts, he said, ‘Maiden of Cumae choose<lb/>
whatever you may wish, and you shall gain<lb/>
all that you wish.’ I pointed to a heap<lb/>
of dust collected there, and foolishly<lb/>
replied, ‘As many birthdays must be given<lb/>
to me as there are particles of sand.’<lb/>

    
“For I forgot to wish them days of changeless youth.<lb/>
He gave long life and offered youth besides,<lb/>
if I would grant his wish. This I refused,<lb/>
I live unwedded still. My happier time<lb/>
has fled away, now comes with tottering step<lb/>
infirm old age, which I shall long endure.<lb/>
You find me ending seven long centuries,<lb/>
and there remain for me, before my years<lb/>
equal the number of those grains of sand,<lb/>
three hundred harvests, three hundred vintages!<lb/>
The time will come, when long increase of days<lb/>
will so contract me from my present size<lb/>
and so far waste away my limbs with age<lb/>
that I shall dwindle to a trifling weight,<lb/>
so trifling, it will never be believed <lb/>
I once was loved and even pleased a god.<lb/>
Perhaps, even Phoebus will not recognize me,<lb/>
or will deny he ever bore me love.<lb/>
But, though I change till eye would never know me,<lb/>
my voice shall live, the fates will leave my voice.”<lb/>


Achaemenides apud Polyphemum.
ULYSSES WITH POLYPHEMUS AND CIRCE

Sibylla with such words beguild their way<lb/>
from Stygian realms up to the Euboean town.<lb/>
Trojan Aeneas, after he had made<lb/>
due sacrifice in Cumae, touched the shore<lb/>
that had not yet been given his nurse's name.<lb/>
There Macareus of Neritus had come,<lb/>
companion of long tried Ulysses, there<lb/>
he rested, weary of his lengthened toils.<lb/>

    
He recognized one left in Aetna's cave,<lb/>
greek Achaemenides, and, all amazed<lb/>
to find him yet alive, he said to him,<lb/>
“What chance, or what god, Achaemenides,<lb/>
preserves you? Why is this barbarian ship<lb/>
conveying you a Greek? What land is sought?”<lb/>

    
No longer ragged in the clothes he wore<lb/>
and his own master, wearing clothes not tacked<lb/>
with sharp thorns, Achaemenides replied,<lb/>
“Again may I see Polyphemus' jaws<lb/>
out-streaming with their slaughtered human blood;<lb/>
if my own home and Ithaca give more<lb/>
delight to me than this barbarian bark,<lb/>
or if I venerate Aeneas less<lb/>
than my own father. If I should give my all,<lb/>
it never could express my gratitude,<lb/>
that I can speak and breath, and see the heavens<lb/>
illuminated by the gleaming sun—<lb/>
how can I be ungrateful and forget all this?<lb/>
Because of him these limbs of mine were spared<lb/>
the Cyclops' jaws; and, though I were even now<lb/>
to leave the light of life, I should at worst<lb/>
be buried in a tomb—not in his maw.<lb/>

    
“What were my feelings when (unless indeed<lb/>
my terror had deprived me of all sense) left there,<lb/>
I saw you making for the open sea?<lb/>
I wished to shout aloud, but was afraid<lb/>
it would betray me to the enemy.<lb/>
The shoutings of Ulysses nearly caused<lb/>
destruction of your ship and there I saw<lb/>
the Cyclops, when he tore a crag away<lb/>
and hurled the huge rock in the whirling waves;<lb/>
I saw him also throw tremendous stones<lb/>
with his gigantic arms. They flew afar,<lb/>
as if impelled by catapults of war,<lb/>
I was struck dumb with terror lest<lb/>
the waves or stones might overwhelm the ship,<lb/>
forgetting that I still was on the shore!<lb/>

    
“But when your flight had saved you from that death<lb/>
of cruelty, the Cyclops, roaring rage,<lb/>
paced all about Mount Aetna, groping through<lb/>
its forests with his outstretched arms. Deprived<lb/>
of sight, he stumbled there against the rocks,<lb/>
until he reached the sea; and stretching out<lb/>
his gore stained arms into its waters there,<lb/>
he cursed all of the Grecian race, and said,<lb/>
‘Oh! that some accident would carry back<lb/>
Ulysses to me, or but one of his<lb/>
companions; against whom my rage<lb/>
might vent itself, whose joints my hand might tear<lb/>
whose blood might drench my throat, whose living limbs<lb/>
might quiver in my teeth. How trifling then,<lb/>
how insignificant would be the loss,<lb/>
of my sight which he took from me!’<lb/>

    
“All this<lb/>
and more he said. A ghastly horror took<lb/>
possession of me when I saw his face<lb/>
and every feature streaming yet with blood,<lb/>
his ruthless hands, and the vile open space<lb/>
where his one eye had been, and his coarse limbs,<lb/>
and his beard matted through with human blood.<lb/>

    
“It seemed as if Death were before my eyes,<lb/>
yet that was but the least part of my woe.<lb/>
I seemed upon the point of being caught,<lb/>
my flesh about to be the food of his.<lb/>
Before my mind was fixed the time I saw<lb/>
two bodies of my loved companions<lb/>
dashed three or four times hard against the ground,<lb/>
when he above them, like a lion, crouched,<lb/>
devouring quickly in his hideous jaws,<lb/>
their entrails and their flesh and their crushed bones,<lb/>
white marrowed, and their mangled quivering limbs.<lb/>
A trembling fear seized on me as I stood<lb/>
pallid and without power to move from there,<lb/>
while I recalled him chewing greedily,<lb/>
and belching out his bloody banquet from<lb/>
his huge mouth—vomiting crushed pieces mixed<lb/>
with phlegmy wine—and I feared such a doom<lb/>
in readiness, awaited wretched me.<lb/>

    
“Most carefully concealed for many days,<lb/>
trembling at every sound and fearing death,<lb/>
although desiring death; I fed myself<lb/>
on grass and acorns, mixed with leaves; alone<lb/>
and destitute, despondent unto death,<lb/>
awaiting my destruction I lost hope.<lb/>
In that condition a long while, at last<lb/>
I saw a ship not far off, and by signs<lb/>
prayed for deliverance, as I ran in haste,<lb/>
down to the shore. My prayers prevailed on them.<lb/>
A Trojan ship took in and saved a Greek!<lb/>

    
“And now, O dearest to me of all men,<lb/>
tell me of your adventures, of your chief<lb/>
and comrades, when you sailed out on the sea.”<lb/>


Macareus. Ulixes et Circe.

Then Macareus told him of Aeolus,<lb/>
the son of Hippotas, whose kingdom is<lb/>
the Tuscan sea, whose prison holds the winds,<lb/>
and how Ulysses had received the winds<lb/>
tied in a bull's hide bag, an awesome gift,<lb/>
how nine days with a favoring breeze they sailed<lb/>
and saw afar their longed for native land.<lb/>
How, as the tenth day dawned, the crew was moved<lb/>
by envy and a lust for gold, which they<lb/>
imagined hidden in that leathern bag<lb/>
and so untied the thong which held the winds.<lb/>
These, rushing out, had driven the vessel back<lb/>
over the waves which they had safely passed,<lb/>
back to the harbor of King Aeolus.<lb/>

    
“From there,” he said, “we sailed until we reached<lb/>
the ancient city of Lamus, Laestrygon.—<lb/>
Antiphates was reigning in that land,<lb/>
and I was sent with two men of our troop,<lb/>
ambassadors to see him. Two of us<lb/>
escaped with difficulty, but the third<lb/>
stained the accursed Lestrygonian's jaws<lb/>
with his devoted blood. Antiphates<lb/>
pursued us, calling out his murderous horde.<lb/>
They came and, hurling stones and heavy beams,<lb/>
they overwhelmed and sank both ships and men.<lb/>
One ship escaped, on which Ulysses sailed.<lb/>

    
“Grieving, lamenting for companions lost,<lb/>
we finally arrived at that land which<lb/>
you may discern far off, and, trust my word,<lb/>
far off it should be seen—I saw it near!<lb/>
And oh most righteous Trojan, Venus' son,<lb/>
Aeneas, whom I call no more a foe,<lb/>
I warn you now: avoid the shores of Circe.<lb/>

    
“We moored our ship beside that country too;<lb/>
but, mindful of the dangers we had run<lb/>
with Laestrygons and cruel Polyphemus,<lb/>
refused to go ashore. Ulysses chose<lb/>
some men by lot and told them to seek out<lb/>
a roof which he had seen among the trees.<lb/>
The lot took me, then staunch Polytes next,<lb/>
Eurylochus, Elpenor fond of wine,<lb/>
and eighteen more and brought us to the walls<lb/>
of Circe's dwelling.<lb/>

    
“As we drew near and stood<lb/>
before the door, a thousand wolves rushed out<lb/>
from woods near by, and with the wolves there ran<lb/>
she bears and lionesses, dread to see.<lb/>
And yet we had no cause to fear, for none<lb/>
would harm us with the smallest scratch.<lb/>
Why, they in friendship even wagged their tails<lb/>
and fawned upon us, while we stood in doubt.<lb/>

    
“Then handmaids took us in and led us on<lb/>
through marble halls to the presence of their queen.<lb/>
She, in a beautiful recess, sat on her throne,<lb/>
clad richly in a shining purple robe,<lb/>
and over it she wore a golden veil.<lb/>
Nereids and nymphs, who never carded fleece<lb/>
with motion of their fingers, nor drew out<lb/>
a ductile thread, were setting potent herbs<lb/>
in proper order and arranging them<lb/>
in baskets—a confusing wealth of flowers<lb/>
were scattered among leaves of every hue:<lb/>
and she prescribed the tasks they all performed.<lb/>

    
“She knew the natural use of every leaf<lb/>
and combinations of their virtues, when<lb/>
mixed properly; and, giving them her close<lb/>
attention, she examined every herb<lb/>
as it was weighed. When she observed us there,<lb/>
and had received our greetings and returned them,<lb/>
she smiled, as if we should be well received.<lb/>
At once she had her maidens bring a drink<lb/>
of parched barley, of honey and strong wine,<lb/>
and curds of milk. And in the nectarous draught<lb/>
she added secretly her baleful drugs.<lb/>

    
“We took the cups presented to us by<lb/>
her sacred right hand; and, as soon as we,<lb/>
so thirsty, quaffed them with our parching mouths,<lb/>
that ruthless goddess with her outstretched wand<lb/>
touched lightly the topmost hair upon our heads.<lb/>
(Although I am ashamed, I tell you this)<lb/>
stiff bristles quickly grew out over me,<lb/>
and I could speak no more. Instead of words<lb/>
I uttered hoarse murmurs and towards the ground<lb/>
began to bend and gaze with all my face.<lb/>
I felt my mouth take on a hardened skin<lb/>
with a long crooked snout, and my neck swell<lb/>
with muscles. With the very member which<lb/>
a moment earlier had received the cup<lb/>
I now made tracks in sand of the palace court.<lb/>
Then with my friends, who suffered a like change<lb/>
(charms have such power!) I was prisoned in a stye.<lb/>

    
“We saw Eurylochus alone avoid<lb/>
our swinish form, for he refused the cup.<lb/>
If he had drained it, I should still remain<lb/>
one of a bristly herd. Nor would his news<lb/>
have made Ulysses sure of our disaster<lb/>
and brought a swift avenger of our fate.<lb/>

    
“Peace bearing Hermes gave him a white flower<lb/>
from a black root, called Moly by the gods.<lb/>
With this protection and the god's advice<lb/>
he entered Circe's hall and, as she gave<lb/>
the treacherous cup and with her magic wand<lb/>
essayed to touch his hair, he drove her back<lb/>
and terrified her with his quick drawn sword.<lb/>
She gave her promise, and, right hands exchanged,<lb/>
he was received unharmed into her couch,<lb/>
where he required the bodies of his friends<lb/>
awarded him, as his prized marriage gift.<lb/>

    
“We then were sprinkled with more favored juice<lb/>
of harmless plants, and smitten on the head<lb/>
with the magic wand reversed. And new charms were<lb/>
repeated, all conversely to the charms<lb/>
which had degraded us. Then, as she sings,<lb/>
more and yet more we raise ourselves erect,<lb/>
the bristles fall off and the fissures leave<lb/>
our cloven feet, our shoulders overcome<lb/>
their lost shape and our arms become attached,<lb/>
as they had been before. With tears of joy<lb/>
we all embrace him, also weeping tears;<lb/>
and we cling fondly to our chieftain's neck;—<lb/>
not one of us could say a single word<lb/>
till thus we had attested gratitude.”<lb/>

PICUS AND CANENS

“The full space of a year detained us there,<lb/>
and I, remaining that long stretch of time,<lb/>
saw many things and heard as much besides:<lb/>
and this among the many other things,<lb/>
was told me secretly by one of the four<lb/>
handmaidens of those rites. While Circe passed<lb/>
her time from all apart except my chief,<lb/>
she brought me to a white marble shape, a youth<lb/>
who bore a woodpecker upon his head.<lb/>
It stood erected in a hallowed place,<lb/>
adorned with many wreaths. When I had asked<lb/>
the statue's name and why he stood revered<lb/>
in that most sacred temple, and what caused<lb/>
that bird he carried on his head; she said:—<lb/>
‘Listen, Macareus, and learn from this tale too<lb/>
the power of Circe, and weigh the knowledge well!’<lb/>


Picus et Canens.

“Picus, offspring of Saturn, was the king<lb/>
of the Ausonian land, one very fond<lb/>
of horses raised for war. The young man's form<lb/>
was just what you now see, and had you known<lb/>
him as he lived, you would not change a line.<lb/>
His nature was as noble as his shape.<lb/>
He could not yet have seen the steeds contend<lb/>
four times in races held with each fifth year<lb/>
at Grecian Elis. But his good looks had charmed<lb/>
the dryads born on Latin hills, Naiads<lb/>
would pine for him—both goddesses of spring<lb/>
and goddesses of fountains, pined for him,<lb/>
and nymphs that live in streaming Albula,<lb/>
Numicus, Anio's course, brief flowing Almo,<lb/>
and rapid Nar and Farfarus, so cool<lb/>
in its delightful shades; all these and those<lb/>
which haunt the forest lake of Scythian<lb/>
Diana and the other nearby lakes.<lb/>

    
“ ‘But, heedless of all these, he loved a nymph<lb/>
whom on the hill, called Palatine, 'tis said,<lb/>
Venilia bore to Janus double faced.<lb/>
When she had reached the age of marriage, she<lb/>
was given to Picus Laurentine, preferred<lb/>
by her above all others—wonderful<lb/>
indeed her beauty, but more wonderful<lb/>
her skill in singing, from which art they called<lb/>
her Canens. The fascination of her voice<lb/>
would move the woods and rocks and tame wild beasts,<lb/>
and stay long rivers, and it even detained<lb/>
the wandering bird. Once, while she sang a lay<lb/>
with high, clear voice, Picus on his keen horse<lb/>
rode in Laurentian fields to hunt the boar,<lb/>
two spears in his left hand, his purple cloak<lb/>
fastened with gold. The daughter of the Sun<lb/>
wandered in woods near by to find new herbs<lb/>
growing on fertile hills, for she had left<lb/>
Circaean fields called so from her own name.<lb/>

    
“ ‘From a concealing thicket she observed<lb/>
the youth with wonder. All the gathered herbs<lb/>
dropped from her hands, forgotten, to the ground<lb/>
and a hot fever-flame seemed to pervade<lb/>
her marrow. When she could collect her thought<lb/>
she wanted to confess her great desire,<lb/>
but the swift horse and his surrounding guards<lb/>
prevented her approach. “Still you shall not<lb/>
escape me,” she declared, “although you may<lb/>
be borne on winds, if I but know myself,<lb/>
and if some potency in herbs remains,<lb/>
and if my art of charms does not deceive.”<lb/>

    
“ ‘Such were her;thoughts, and then she formed<lb/>
an image of a bodiless wild swine<lb/>
and let it cross the trail before the king<lb/>
and rush into a woodland dense with trees,<lb/>
which fallen trunks made pathless for his horse.<lb/>
Picus at once, unconscious of all harm,<lb/>
followed the phantom-prey and, hastily<lb/>
quitting the reeking back of his good steed,<lb/>
he wandered in pursuit of a vain hope,<lb/>
on foot through that deep wood. She seized the chance<lb/>
and by her incantation called strange gods<lb/>
with a strange charm, which had the power to hide<lb/>
the white moon's features and draw thirsty clouds<lb/>
about her father's head. The changing sky<lb/>
then lowered more black at each repeated tone<lb/>
of incantation, and the ground exhaled<lb/>
its vapours, while his people wandered there<lb/>
along the darkened paths until no guard<lb/>
was near to aid the imperiled king.<lb/>

    
“ ‘Having now gained an opportunity<lb/>
and place, she said, “ O, youth most beautiful!<lb/>
By those fine eyes, which captivated mine,<lb/>
and by that graceful person, which brings me,<lb/>
even me, a goddess, suppliant to you,<lb/>
have pity on my passion; let the Sun,<lb/>
who looks on all things, be your father-in-law;<lb/>
do not despise Circe, the Titaness.”<lb/>

    
“But fiercely he repelled her and her prayer,<lb/>
“Whoever you may be, you are not mine,”<lb/>
he said. “Another lady has my heart.<lb/>
I pray that for a lengthening space of time<lb/>
she may so hold me. I will not pollute<lb/>
conjugal ties with the unhallowed loves<lb/>
of any stranger, while the Fates preserve<lb/>
to me the child of Janus, my dear Canens.”<lb/>

    
“‘Titan's daughter, when many pleas had failed,<lb/>
said angrily, “You shall not leave me with<lb/>
impunity, and you shall not return<lb/>
to Canens; and by your experience<lb/>
you shall now learn what can be done by her<lb/>
so slighted—what a woman deep in love<lb/>
can do— and Circe is that slighted love.”<lb/>

    
“ ‘Then twice she turned herself to face the west<lb/>
and twice to face the East; and three times then<lb/>
she touched the young man with her wand,<lb/>
and sang three incantations. Picus fled,<lb/>
but, marvelling at his unaccustomed speed,<lb/>
he saw new wings, that spread on either side<lb/>
and bore him onward. Angry at the thought<lb/>
of transformation—all so suddenly<lb/>
added a strange bird to the Latian woods,<lb/>
he struck the wild oaks with his hard new beak,<lb/>
and in his rage inflicted many wounds<lb/>
on the long waving branches his wings took<lb/>
the purple of his robe. The piece of gold<lb/>
which he had used so nicely in his robe<lb/>
was changed to golden feathers, and his neck<lb/>
was rich as yellow gold. Nothing remained<lb/>
of Picus as he was except the name.<lb/>

    
“ ‘While all this happened his attendants called<lb/>
on Picus often but in vain throughout<lb/>
surrounding fields, and finding not a trace<lb/>
of their young king, at length by chance they met<lb/>
with Circe, who had cleared the darkened air<lb/>
and let the clouds disperse before the wind<lb/>
and clear rays of the sun. Then with good cause<lb/>
they blamed her, they demanded the return<lb/>
of their lost king, and with their hunting spears<lb/>
they threatened her. She, sprinkling baleful drugs<lb/>
and poison juices over them, invoked<lb/>
the aid of Night and all the gods of Night<lb/>
from Erebus and Chaos, and desired<lb/>
the aid of Hecat with long, wailing cries.<lb/>

    
“ ‘Most wonderful to tell, the forests leaped<lb/>
from fixed localities and the torn soil<lb/>
uttered deep groans, the trees surrounding changed<lb/>
from life-green to sick pallor, and the grass<lb/>
was moistened with besprinkling drops of blood;<lb/>
the stones sent forth harsh longings, unknown dogs<lb/>
barked loudly, and the ground became a mass<lb/>
of filthy snakes, and unsubstantial hosts<lb/>
of the departed flitted without sound.<lb/>
The men all quaked appalled. With magic rod<lb/>
she touched their faces, pale and all amazed,<lb/>
and at her touch the youths took on strange forms<lb/>
of wild animals. None kept his proper shape.<lb/>

    
“ ‘The setting sun is resting low upon<lb/>
the far Tartessian shores, and now in vain<lb/>
her husband is expected by the eyes<lb/>
of longing Canens. Her slaves and people run<lb/>
about through all the forest, holding lights<lb/>
to meet him. Nor is it enough for that<lb/>
dear nymph to weep and frenzied tear her hair<lb/>
and beat her breast—she did all that and more.<lb/>
Distracted she rushed forth and wandered through<lb/>
the Latin fields. Six nights, six brightening dawns<lb/>
found her quite unrefreshed with food or sleep<lb/>
wandering at random over hill and dale.<lb/>
The Tiber saw her last, with grief and toil<lb/>
wearied and lying on his widespread bank.<lb/>
In tears she poured out words with a faint voice,<lb/>
lamenting her sad woe, as when the swan<lb/>
about to die sings a funereal dirge.<lb/>
Melting with grief at last she pined away;<lb/>
her flesh, her bones, her marrow liquified<lb/>
and vanished by degrees as formless air<lb/>
and yet the story lingers near that place,<lb/>
fitly named Canens by old-time Camenae!.’<lb/>

    
“Such things I heard and saw through a long year.<lb/>
Sluggish, inactive through our idleness,<lb/>
we were all ordered to embark again<lb/>
out on the deep, again to set our sails.<lb/>
The Titaness explained the doubtful paths,<lb/>
the great extent and peril, of wild seas.<lb/>
I was alarmed, I will confess to you;<lb/>
so, having reached these shores, I have remained.”<lb/>


Diomedis socii. Oleaster.
DIOMED'S FOLLOWERS TRANSFORMED

Macareus finished. And Aeneas' nurse,<lb/>
now buried in a marble urn, had this<lb/>
brief, strange inscription on her tomb:—<lb/>
“My foster-child of proven piety,<lb/>
burned me Caieta here: although<lb/>
I was at first preserved from Argive fire,<lb/>
I later burned with fire which was my due.”<lb/>

    
The cable loosened from the grassy bank,<lb/>
they steered a course which kept them well away<lb/>
from ill famed Circe's wiles and from her home<lb/>
and sought the groves where Tiber dark with shade,<lb/>
breaks with his yellow sands into the sea.<lb/>

    
Aeneas then fell heir to the home and won<lb/>
the daughter of Latinus, Faunus' son,<lb/>
not without war. A people very fierce<lb/>
made war, and Turnus, their young chief,<lb/>
indignant fought to hold a promised bride.<lb/>
With Latium all Etruria was embroiled,<lb/>
a victory hard to win was sought through war.<lb/>
By foreign aid each side got further strength:<lb/>
the camp of Rutuli abounds in men,<lb/>
and many throng the opposing camp of Troy.<lb/>
Aeneas did not find Evander's home<lb/>
in vain. But Venulus with no success<lb/>
came to the realm of exiled Diomed.<lb/>
That hero had marked out his mighty walls<lb/>
with favor of Iapygian Daunus and<lb/>
held fields that came to him as marriage dower.<lb/>

    
When Venulus, by Turnus' orders, made<lb/>
request for aid, the Aetolian hero said<lb/>
that he was poor in men: he did not wish<lb/>
to risk in battle himself nor any troops<lb/>
belonging to his father-in-law and had<lb/>
no troops of his that he could arm for battle.<lb/>
“Lest you should think I feign,” he then went on<lb/>
“Although my grief must be renewed because<lb/>
of bitter recollections of the past,<lb/>
I will endure recital now to you:—<lb/>

    
“After the lofty Ilion was burnt<lb/>
and Pergama had fed the Grecian flames,<lb/>
and Ajax, the Narycian hero, had<lb/>
brought from a virgin, for a virgin wronged,<lb/>
the punishment which he alone deserved<lb/>
on our whole expedition, we were then<lb/>
dispersed and driven by violent winds<lb/>
over the hostile seas; and we, the Greeks,<lb/>
had to endure in darkness, lightning, rain,<lb/>
the wrath both of the heavens and of the sea,<lb/>
and Caphareus, the climax of our woe.<lb/>
Not to detain you by relating such<lb/>
unhappy things in order, Greece might then<lb/>
have seemed to merit even Priam's tears.<lb/>

    
“Although well armed Minerva's care preserved<lb/>
me then and brought me safe through rocks and waves,<lb/>
from my native Argos I was driven again,<lb/>
for outraged Venus took her full revenge<lb/>
remembering still that wound of long ago;<lb/>
and I endured such hardships on the deep,<lb/>
and hazards amid armies on the shore,<lb/>
that often I called those happy whom the storm—<lb/>
an ill that came on all, or Cephareus had drowned.<lb/>
I even wished I had been one of them.<lb/>

    
“My best companions having now endured<lb/>
utmost extremities in wars and seas,<lb/>
lost courage and demanded a swift end<lb/>
of our long wandering. Acmon, by nature hot,<lb/>
and much embittered by misfortune, said,<lb/>
‘What now remains for you, my friends,<lb/>
that patience can endure? What can be done<lb/>
by Venus (if she wants to) more than she<lb/>
already has done? While we have a dread<lb/>
of greater evils, reason will be found<lb/>
for patience; but, when fortune brings her worst,<lb/>
we scorn and trample fear beneath our feet.<lb/>
Upon the height of woe, why should we care?<lb/>
Let Venus listen, let her hate Diomed<lb/>
more than all others—as indeed she does,<lb/>
we all despise her hate. At a great price<lb/>
we have bought and won the right to such contempt!’<lb/>

    
“With language of this kind Pleuronian Acmon.<lb/>
Provoking Venus further than before,<lb/>
revived her former anger. His fierce words<lb/>
were then approved of by a few, while we<lb/>
the greater number of his real friends,<lb/>
rebuked the words of Acmon: and while he<lb/>
prepared to answer us, his voice, and even<lb/>
the passage of his voice, were both at once<lb/>
diminished, his hair changed to feathers, while<lb/>
his neck took a new form. His breast and back<lb/>
covered themselves with down, and both his arms<lb/>
grew longer feathers, and his elbows curved<lb/>
into light wings, much of each foot was changed<lb/>
to long toes, and his mouth grew still and hard<lb/>
with pointed horn.<lb/>

    
“Amazed at his swift change<lb/>
were Lycus, Abas, Nycteus and Rhexenor.<lb/>
And, while they stared, they took his feathered shape.<lb/>
The larger portion of my company<lb/>
flew from their boat, resounding all around<lb/>
our oars with flapping of new-fashioned wings.<lb/>
If you should ask the form of these strange birds<lb/>
they were like snowy swans, though not the same.<lb/>

    
“Now as Iapygian Daunus' son-in-law<lb/>
I scarcely hold this town and arid fields<lb/>
with my small remnant of trustworthy men.”<lb/>

METAMORPHOSES RELATED TO AENEAS

So Diomed made answer. Venulus<lb/>
soon after left the Calydonian realms,<lb/>
Peucetian bays, and the Messapian fields.<lb/>
Among those fields he saw a darkened cave<lb/>
in woods and waving reeds. The halfgoat Pan<lb/>
now lives there, but in older time the nymphs<lb/>
possessed it. An Apulian shepherd scared<lb/>
them from that spot. At first he terrified<lb/>
them with a sudden fear, but soon in scorn,<lb/>
as they considered what the intruder was,	<lb/>
they danced before him, moving feet to time.<lb/>
The shepherd clown abused them, capering,<lb/>
grotesquely imitating graceful steps,<lb/>
and railed at them with coarse and foolish words.<lb/>
He was not silent till a tree's new bark<lb/>
had closed his mouth for now he is a tree.<lb/>
And the wild olive's fruit took bitterness<lb/>
from him. It has the tartness of his tongue.<lb/>


Aeneae naves. Ardea.

When the ambassadors returned and told<lb/>
their tale about Aetolian arms refused,<lb/>
the bold Rutulians carried on the war<lb/>
without those forces, and much blood was shed.<lb/>
Then Turnus with a greedy torch drew near<lb/>
the Trojan fleet, well built of close-knit pine.<lb/>
What had escaped the waves, now feared the flame.<lb/>
Soon Mulciber was burning pitch and wax<lb/>
and other food of fire, up the high masts<lb/>
he ran and fed upon the tight furled sails,<lb/>
and even the benches in the curved hull smoked.<lb/>
When the holy mother of the gods, recalling<lb/>
how those same pines were felled on Ida's crest,<lb/>
filled the wind with a sound of cymbals clashed<lb/>
and trill of boxwood flutes. Borne through light air<lb/>
by her famed lion yoke, she came and said,<lb/>
“In vain you cast the fire with impious hand,<lb/>
Turnus, for I will save this burning fleet.<lb/>
I will not let the greedy flame consume<lb/>
trees that were part and members of my grove.”<lb/>

    
It thundered while she spoke, and heavy clouds,<lb/>
following the thunder, brought a storm<lb/>
of bounding hail. The Astraean brothers filled<lb/>
both air and swollen waters with their rage<lb/>
and rushed to battle. With the aid of one<lb/>
of them the kindly mother broke the ropes<lb/>
which held the Phrygian ships, and, drawing all<lb/>
prow foremost, plunged them underneath the wave.<lb/>
Softening quickly in the waters quiet depth,<lb/>
their wood was changed to flesh, the curving prows<lb/>
were metamorphosed into human heads,<lb/>
blades of the oars made feet, the looms were changed<lb/>
to swimming legs, the sides turned human flanks,<lb/>
each keel below the middle of a ship<lb/>
transformed became a spine, the cordage changed<lb/>
to soft hair, and the sail yards changed to arms.<lb/>
The azure color of the ships remained.<lb/>

    
As sea-nymphs in the water they began<lb/>
to agitate with virgin sports the waves,<lb/>
which they had always dreaded. Natives of<lb/>
the rugged mountains they are now so changed,<lb/>
they swim and dwell in the soft flowing sea,<lb/>
with every influence of birth forgot.<lb/>
Never forgetful of the myriad risks<lb/>
they have endured among the boisterous waves,<lb/>
they often give a helping hand to ships<lb/>
tossed in the power of storms—unless, of course,<lb/>
the ship might carry men of Grecian race.<lb/>

    
Never forgetful of the Phrygians and<lb/>
catastrophe, their hatred was so great<lb/>
of all Pelasgians, that they looked with joy<lb/>
upon the fragments of Ulysses' ship;<lb/>
and were delighted when they saw the ship<lb/>
of King Alcinous growing hard upon<lb/>
the breakers, as its wood was turned to stone.<lb/>

    
Many were hopeful that a fleet which had<lb/>
received life strangely in the forms of nymphs<lb/>
would cause the chieftain of the Rutuli<lb/>
to feel such awe that he would end their strife.<lb/>
But he continued fighting, and each side<lb/>
had its own gods, and each had courage too,<lb/>
which often can be as potent as the gods.<lb/>

    
Now they forgot the kingdom as a dower,<lb/>
forgot the scepter of a father-in-law,<lb/>
and even forgot the pure Lavinia:<lb/>
their one thought was to conquer, and they waged<lb/>
war to prevent the shame of a defeat.<lb/>

    
But Venus finally beheld the arms<lb/>
of her victorious son; for Turnus fell,<lb/>
and Ardea fell, a town which, while he lived,<lb/>
was counted strong. The Trojan swords<lb/>
destroyed it.—All its houses burned and sank<lb/>
down in the heated embers: and a bird<lb/>
not known before that time, flew upward from<lb/>
a wrecked heap, beating the dead ashes with<lb/>
its flapping wings. The voice, the lean pale look,<lb/>
the sorrows of a captured city, even<lb/>
the name of the ruined city, all these things<lb/>
remain in that bird—Ardea's fallen walls<lb/>
are beaten in lamentation by his wings.<lb/>


Aeneas Indiges.

The merit of Aeneas now had moved<lb/>
the gods. Even Juno stayed her lasting hate,<lb/>
when, with the state of young Iulus safe,<lb/>
the hero son of Cytherea was<lb/>
prepared for heaven. In a council of the gods<lb/>
Venus arose, embraced her father's neck,<lb/>
and said: “ My father, ever kind to me,<lb/>
I do beseech your kind indulgence now;<lb/>
grant, dearest, to Aeneas, my own son<lb/>
and also your own grandson, grant to him<lb/>
a godhead power, although of lowest class,<lb/>
sufficient if but granted. It is enough<lb/>
to have looked once upon the unlovely realm.<lb/>
And once to have gone across the Stygian streams.”<lb/>

    
The gods assented, and the queen of Jove<lb/>
nodded consent with calm, approving face.<lb/>
The father said, “You well deserve the gift,<lb/>
both you who ask it, and the one for whom<lb/>
you ask it: what you most desire is yours,<lb/>
my daughter.” He decreed, and she rejoiced<lb/>
and thanked her parent. Borne by harnessed doves<lb/>
over and through the light air, she arrived<lb/>
safe on Laurentine shores: Numicius there<lb/>
winds through his tall reeds to the neighboring sea<lb/>
the waters of his stream: and there she willed<lb/>
Numicius should wash perfectly away<lb/>
from her Aeneas every part that might<lb/>
be subject unto death; and bear it far<lb/>
with quiet current into Neptune's realm.<lb/>

    
The horned Numicius satisfied the will<lb/>
of Venus; and with flowing waters washed<lb/>
from her Aeneas every mortal part,<lb/>
and sprinkled him, so that the essential part<lb/>
of immortality remained alone,<lb/>
and she anointed him, thus purified,<lb/>
with heavenly essence, and she touched his face<lb/>
with sweetest nectar and ambrosia mixt,<lb/>
thereby transforming him into a god.<lb/>
The throng of the Quirini later named<lb/>
the new god Indiges, and honored him.<lb/>


Pomona et Vertumnus. Anaxarete.
VERTUMNUS AND POMONA

Under the scepter of Ascanius<lb/>
the Latin state, transferred, was Alban too.<lb/>
Silvius ruled after him. Latinus then,<lb/>
wearing the crown, brought back an older name.<lb/>
Illustrious Alba followed after him,<lb/>
Epytus next in time, and Capys next,<lb/>
then Capetus. And reigning after them<lb/>
King Tiberinus followed. He was drowned<lb/>
in waves of that Etrurian stream, to which<lb/>
he gave his name. His sons were Remulus<lb/>
and fierce Acrota—each in turn was king.<lb/>
The elder, Remulus, would imitate<lb/>
the lightning, and he perished by a flash<lb/>
of lightning. Then Acrota, not so rash,<lb/>
succeeded to his brother, and he left<lb/>
his scepter to the valiant Aventinus,<lb/>
hill-buried on the very mountain which<lb/>
he ruled upon and which received his name.<lb/>
And Proca ruled then—on the Palatine.<lb/>

    
Under this king, Pomona lived, and none<lb/>
of all the Latin hamadryads could<lb/>
attend her garden with more skill, and none<lb/>
was more attentive to the fruitful trees,<lb/>
because of them her name was given to her.<lb/>

    
She cared not for the forests or the streams,<lb/>
but loved the country and the boughs that bear<lb/>
delicious fruit. Her right hand never felt<lb/>
a javelin's weight, always she loved to hold<lb/>
a sharp curved pruning-knife with which she would<lb/>
at one time crop too largely growing shoots,<lb/>
or at another time reduce the branch<lb/>
that straggled; at another time she would<lb/>
engraft a sucker in divided bark,<lb/>
and so find nourishment for some young, strange<lb/>
nursling. She never suffered them to thirst,<lb/>
for she would water every winding thread<lb/>
of twisting roots with freshly flowing streams.<lb/>

    
All this was her delight, her chief pursuit;<lb/>
she never felt the least desire of love;<lb/>
but fearful of some rustic's violence,<lb/>
she had her orchard closed within a wall;<lb/>
and both forbade and fled the approach of males.<lb/>

    
What did not satyrs do to gain her love,<lb/>
a youthful crew expert at every dance?<lb/>
And also Pans their brows wreathed with the pine,<lb/>
Silenus too, more youthful than his years,<lb/>
and that god who is ever scaring thieves<lb/>
with pruning-hook or limb—what did they not<lb/>
to gain her love? And though Vertumnus did<lb/>
exceed them in his love, yet he was not<lb/>
more fortunate than they.<lb/>

    
How often disguised<lb/>
as a rough reaper he brought her barley ears—<lb/>
truly he seemed a reaper to the life!<lb/>
Often he came, his temples wreathed with hay,<lb/>
as if he had been tossing new mown grass.<lb/>
He often held a whip in his tough hand,<lb/>
you could have sworn he had a moment before<lb/>
unyoked his wearied oxen. When he had<lb/>
a pruning-knife, he seemed to rear fine fruit<lb/>
in orchard trees or in the well kept vines.<lb/>
When he came with a ladder, you would think<lb/>
he must be gathering fruit. Sometimes he was<lb/>
a soldier with a sword—a fisherman,<lb/>
the rod held in his hand.—In fact by means<lb/>
of many shapes he often had obtained<lb/>
access to her and joyed in seeing her beauty.<lb/>

    
At length he had his brows bound with a cap<lb/>
of color, and then leaning on a stick,<lb/>
with white hair round his temples, he assumed<lb/>
the shape of an old woman. Entering so<lb/>
the cultivated garden, he admired<lb/>
the fruit and said, “But you are so much lovelier!”<lb/>
And, while he praised her, gave some kisses too,<lb/>
such as no real beldame ever gave.<lb/>
The bent old creature then sat on the grass.<lb/>
Gazing at branches weighed down with their fruit<lb/>
of autumn. Opposite to them there was<lb/>
an elm-tree beautiful with shining grapes;<lb/>
and, after he had praised it with the vine<lb/>
embracing it, he said,<lb/>

    
“But only think,<lb/>
if this trunk stood unwedded to this vine,<lb/>
it would have nothing to attract our hearts<lb/>
beyond its leaves, and this delightful vine,<lb/>
united to the elm tree finds its rest;<lb/>
but, if not so joined to it, would fall down,<lb/>
prostrate upon the ground. And yet you find<lb/>
no warning in the example of this tree.<lb/>
You have avoided marriage, with no wish<lb/>
to be united—I must wish that you<lb/>
would change and soon desire it. Helen would<lb/>
not have so many suitors for her hand, nor she<lb/>
who caused the battles of the Lapithae,<lb/>
nor would the wife of timid, and not bold,<lb/>
Ulysses. Even now, while you avoid<lb/>
those who are courting you, and while you turn<lb/>
in your disgust, a thousand suitors want<lb/>
to marry you—the demigods and gods,<lb/>
and deities of Alba's mountain-tops.<lb/>

    
“But you, if you are wise, and wish to make<lb/>
a good match, listen patiently to me, <lb/>
an old, old woman (I love you much more<lb/>
than all of them, more than you dream or think).<lb/>
Despise all common persons, and choose now<lb/>
Vertumnus as the partner of your couch,<lb/>
and you may take me as a surety for him.<lb/>
He is not better known even to himself,<lb/>
than he is known to me. And he is not<lb/>
now wandering everywhere, from here to there<lb/>
throughout the world. He always will frequent<lb/>
the places near here; and he does not, like<lb/>
so many of your wooers, fall in love<lb/>
with her he happens to have seen the last.<lb/>
You are his first and last love, and to you<lb/>
alone will he devote his life. Besides<lb/>
all—he is young and has a natural gift<lb/>
of grace, so that he can most readily<lb/>
transform himself to any wanted shape,<lb/>
and will become whatever you may wish—<lb/>
even though you ask him things unseen before.<lb/>

    
“And only think, have you not the same tastes?<lb/>
Will he not be the first to welcome fruits<lb/>
which are your great delight? And does he not<lb/>
hold your gifts safely in his glad right hand?<lb/>
But now he does not long for any fruit<lb/>
plucked from the tree, and has no thought of herbs<lb/>
with pleasant juices that the garden gives;<lb/>
he cannot think of anything but you.<lb/>
Have pity on his passion, and believe<lb/>
that he who woos you is here and he pleads<lb/>
with my lips.<lb/>

    
“You should not forget to fear<lb/>
avenging deities, and the Idalian,<lb/>
who hate all cruel hearts, and also dread<lb/>
the fierce revenge of her of Rhamnus-Land.<lb/>
And that you may stand more in awe of them,<lb/>
(old age has given me opportunities<lb/>
of knowing many things) I will relate<lb/>
some happenings known in Cyprus, by which you<lb/>
may be persuaded and relent with ease.<lb/>


ANAXARETE TRANSFORMED

“Iphis, born of a humble family,<lb/>
had seen the famed Anaxarete, who<lb/>
was of the race of ancient Teucer.—He<lb/>
had seen her and felt fire inflame his bones.<lb/>
Struggling a long time, he could not subdue<lb/>
his passion by his reason, so he came<lb/>
a suppliant to her doors. And having now<lb/>
confessed his ardent passion to her nurse,<lb/>
besought her by the hopes reposed in her<lb/>
by the loved girl, not to give him a cold heart<lb/>
and at another time, with fair words given<lb/>
to each of many servants he besought<lb/>
their kindest interest with an anxious voice.<lb/>
He often gave them coaxing words engraved<lb/>
on tablets of soft wax; and sometimes he<lb/>
would fasten garlands, wet with dew of tears,<lb/>
upon the door-posts; and he often laid<lb/>
his tender side nightlong on the hard threshold,<lb/>
sadly reproaching the obdurate bolt.<lb/>

    
“Deafer than the deep sea that rises high<lb/>
when the rainy Constellation of the Kids<lb/>
is setting; harder than the iron which<lb/>
the fire of Noricum refines; more hard<lb/>
than rock which in its native state is fixed<lb/>
firm rooted; she despised and laughed at him,<lb/>
and, adding to her cruel deeds and pride,<lb/>
she boasted and deprived him of all hope.<lb/>

    
“Iphis, unable to endure such pain prolonged,<lb/>
spoke these, his final words, before her door:<lb/>
‘Anaxarete, you have conquered me,<lb/>
and you shall have no more annoyances<lb/>
to bear from me. Be joyful and prepare<lb/>
your triumph, and invoke god Paean, crown<lb/>
yourself with shining laurel. You are now<lb/>
my conqueror, and I resigned will die.<lb/>
Woman of iron, rejoice in victory!<lb/>

    
“At least, you will commend me for one thing,<lb/>
one point in which I must please even you,<lb/>
and cause you to confess my right of praise.<lb/>
Remember that my star crossed love for you<lb/>
died only with the last breath of my life.<lb/>
And now in one short moment I shall be<lb/>
deprived a twofold light; and no report<lb/>
will come to you, no messenger of death.<lb/>
But doubt not, I will come to you so that<lb/>
I can be seen in person, and you may<lb/>
then satiate your cruel eyesight with<lb/>
my lifeless body. If, you gods above!<lb/>
You have some knowledge of our mortal ways<lb/>
remember me, for now my tongue can pray<lb/>
no longer. Let me be renowned in times<lb/>
far distant and give all those hours to Fame<lb/>
which you have taken from my life on earth.’<lb/>

    
“Then to the doorpost which he often had<lb/>
adorned with floral wreaths he lifted up<lb/>
his swimming eyes and both his pallid arms,<lb/>
and, when he had fastened over the capital<lb/>
a rope that held a dangling noose, he said,—<lb/>
“Are these the garlands that delight your heart?<lb/>
You cruel and unnatural woman?”—Then,<lb/>
thrust in his head, turning even then towards her,<lb/>
and hung a hapless weight with broken neck.<lb/>

    
“The door, struck by the motion of his feet<lb/>
as they were quivering, seemed to utter sounds<lb/>
of groaning, and, when it flew open, showed<lb/>
the sad sight. All the servants cried aloud,<lb/>
and after they had tried in vain to save him,<lb/>
carried him from there to his mother's house,<lb/>
(to her because his father was then dead).<lb/>

    
“She held him to her bosom and embraced<lb/>
the cold limbs of her dead child. After she<lb/>
had uttered words so natural to the grief<lb/>
of wretched mothers—after she had done<lb/>
what wretched mothers do at such sad times,<lb/>
she led a tearful funeral through the streets,<lb/>
the pale corpse following high upon the bier,<lb/>
on to a pyre laid in the central square.<lb/>
By chance, Anaxarete's house was near<lb/>
the way through which the mournful funeral<lb/>
was going with the corpse, and the sad sound<lb/>
of wailing reached the ears of that proud girl—<lb/>
hardhearted, and already goaded on<lb/>
by an avenging god. Moved by the sound,<lb/>
she said; “Let me observe their sniveling rites.”<lb/>
And she ascended to an upper room,<lb/>
provided with wide windows. Scarcely had<lb/>
she looked at Iphis, laid out on the bier,<lb/>
when her eyes stiffened, and she turned all white,<lb/>
as warm blood left her body. She tried then<lb/>
to turn back from the window, but she stood<lb/>
transfixed there. She then tried to turn her face<lb/>
away from that sad sight, but could not move;<lb/>
and by degrees the stone, which always had<lb/>
existed, petrified in her cold breast,<lb/>
and took possession of her heart and limbs.<lb/>

    
“This is not fiction, and that you may know,<lb/>
Salamis keeps that statue safe today,<lb/>
formed of the virgin and has also built<lb/>
a temple called, ‘Venus the watchful Goddess.’<lb/>
Warned by her fate, O sweet nymph, lay aside<lb/>
prolonged disdain, and cheerfully unite<lb/>
yourself to one who loves you. Then may frost<lb/>
of springtime never nip your fruit in bud,<lb/>
nor rude winds strike the blossom.”<lb/>

    
When the god,<lb/>
fitted for every shape, had said these words in vain,<lb/>
he laid the old woman's form aside and was<lb/>
again a youth. On her he seemed to blaze,<lb/>
as when the full light of the brilliant Sun,<lb/>
after it has dispelled opposing clouds,<lb/>
has shone forth with not one to intercept.<lb/>

    
He purposed violence, but there was then<lb/>
no need of force. The lovely nymph was charmed,<lb/>
was captivated by the god's bright form<lb/>
and felt a passion answering to his love.<lb/>


Romulus et Hersilia.
TALES ABOUT ROMULUS

At Proca's death unjust Amulius<lb/>
seized with his troops the whole Ausonian wealth.<lb/>
And yet old Numitor, obtaining aid<lb/>
from his two grandsons, won the land again<lb/>
which he had lost; and on the festival<lb/>
of Pales were the city walls begun.<lb/>
King Tatius with his Sabines went to war;<lb/>
Tarpeia, who betrayed the citadel,<lb/>
died justly underneath the weight of arms.<lb/>

    
Then troops from Cures crept, like silent wolves,<lb/>
without a word toward men subdued by sleep<lb/>
and tried the gates that Ilia's son had barred.<lb/>
Then Saturn's daughter opened wide a gate,<lb/>
turning the silent hinge. Venus alone<lb/>
perceived the bars of that gate falling down.<lb/>
She surely would have closed it, were it not<lb/>
impossible for any deity<lb/>
to countervail the acts of other gods.<lb/>

    
The Naiads of Ausonia occupied<lb/>
a spring that welled up close to Janus' fane.<lb/>
To them she prayed for aid. The fountain-nymphs<lb/>
could not resist the prayer of Venus, when<lb/>
she made her worthy plea and they released<lb/>
all waters under ground. Till then the path<lb/>
by Janus' fane was open, never yet had floods<lb/>
risen to impede the way. But now they laid<lb/>
hot sulphur of a faint blue light beneath<lb/>
the streaming fountain and with care applied<lb/>
fire to the hallowed ways with smoking pitch.<lb/>

    
By these and many other violent means<lb/>
hot vapors penetrated to the source<lb/>
of the good fountain.—Only think of it!<lb/>
Those waters which had rivalled the cold Alps,<lb/>
now rivalled with their heat the flames themselves!<lb/>
And, while each gate post steamed with boiling spray,<lb/>
the gate, which had been opened (but in vain)<lb/>
to hardy Sabines just outside, was made<lb/>
impassable by the heated fountain's flood,<lb/>
till Roman soldiers had regained their arms.<lb/>

    
After brave Romulus had led them forth<lb/>
and covered Roman ground with Sabines dead<lb/>
and its own people; and the accursed sword<lb/>
shed blood of father-in-law and son-in-law,<lb/>
with peace they chose at last to end the war,<lb/>
rather than fight on to the bitter end:<lb/>
Tatius and Romulus divide the throne.<lb/>

    
Tatius had fallen, and you, O Romulus,<lb/>
were giving laws to peoples now made one,<lb/>
when Mars put off his helmet and addressed<lb/>
the father of gods and men in words like these:<lb/>
“The time has come, for now the Roman state<lb/>
has been established on a strong foundation<lb/>
and no more must rely on one man's strength<lb/>
the time has come for you to give the prize,<lb/>
promised to me and your deserving grandson,<lb/>
to raise him from the earth and grant him here<lb/>
a fitting place in heaven. One day you said<lb/>
to me before a council of the gods,<lb/>
(for I recall now with a grateful mind<lb/>
how I took note of your most gracious speech)<lb/>
‘Him you shall lift up to the blue of heaven.’<lb/>
Now let all know the meaning of your words!”<lb/>

    
The god all-powerful nodded his assent,<lb/>
and he obscured the air with heavy clouds<lb/>
and on a trembling world he sent below<lb/>
harsh thunder and bright lightning. Mars at once<lb/>
perceived it was a signal plainly given<lb/>
for promised change—so, leaning on a spear,<lb/>
he mounted boldly into his chariot,<lb/>
and over bloodstained yoke and eager steeds<lb/>
he swung and cracked the loud-resounding lash.<lb/>

    
Descending through steep air, he halted on<lb/>
the wooded summit of the Palatine<lb/>
and there, while Ilia's son was giving laws—<lb/>
needing no pomp and circumstance of kings,<lb/>
Mars caught him up. His mortal flesh dissolved<lb/>
into thin air, as when a ball of lead<lb/>
shot up from a broad sling melts all away<lb/>
and soon is lost in heaven. A nobler shape<lb/>
was given him, one more fitted to adorn<lb/>
rich couches in high heaven, the shape divine<lb/>
of Quirinus clad in the trabea.<lb/>

    
His queen, Hersilia, wept continually,<lb/>
regarding him as lost, till regal Juno<lb/>
commanded Iris to glide down along<lb/>
her curving bow and bring to her these words:<lb/>

    
“O matron, glory of the Latin race<lb/>
and of the Sabines, worthy to have been<lb/>
the consort chosen by so great a man<lb/>
and now to be his partner as the god<lb/>
Quirinus, weep no more. If you desire<lb/>
to see your husband, let me guide you up<lb/>
to a grove that crowns the hill of Quirinus,<lb/>
shading a temple of the Roman king.”<lb/>

    
Iris obeyed her will, and, gliding down<lb/>
to earth along her tinted bow, conveyed<lb/>
the message to Hersilia; who replied,<lb/>
with modest look and hardly lifted eye,<lb/>
“Goddess (although it is not in my power<lb/>
to say your name, I am quite certain you<lb/>
must be a goddess), lead me, O lead me<lb/>
until you show to me the hallowed form<lb/>
of my beloved husband. If the Fates<lb/>
will but permit me once again to see<lb/>
his features, I will say I have won heaven.”<lb/>

    
At once Hersilia and the virgin child<lb/>
of Thaumas, went together up the hill<lb/>
of Romulus. Descending through thin air<lb/>
there came a star, and then Hersilia<lb/>
her tresses glowing fiery in the light,<lb/>
rose with that star, as it returned through air.<lb/>
And her the founder of the Roman state<lb/>
received with dear, familiar hands. He changed<lb/>
her old time form and with the form her name.<lb/>
He called her Hora and let her become<lb/>
a goddess, now the mate of Quirinus.<lb/>

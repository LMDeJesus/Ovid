Iason et Medea.
JASON AND MEDEA

Over the storm-tossed waves, the Argonauts<lb/>
had sailed in Argo, their long ship to where<lb/>
King Phineus, needy in his old age, reigned—<lb/>
deprived of sight and feeble. When the sons<lb/>
of Boreas had landed on the shore,<lb/>
and seen the Harpies snatching from the king<lb/>
his nourishment, befouling it with beaks<lb/>
obscene, they drove those human-vultures thence.<lb/>

    
And having suffered hardships and great toils,<lb/>
after the day they rescued the sad king<lb/>
from the vile Harpies, those twin valiant youths,<lb/>
Zetes and Calais came with their chief,<lb/>
the mighty Jason, where the Phasis flows.<lb/>

    
From the green margin of that river, all<lb/>
the crew of Argonauts, by Jason led,<lb/>
went to the king Aeetes and required<lb/>
the Golden Fleece, that he received from Phryxus.<lb/>
When they had bargained with him, full of wiles<lb/>
he offered to restore the Golden Fleece<lb/>
only to those who might to him return,<lb/>
victorious from hard labors of great risk.<lb/>

    
Medea, the king's daughter, near his throne,<lb/>
saw Jason, leader of the Argonauts,<lb/>
as he was pressing to secure a prize—<lb/>
and loved at sight with a consuming flame.<lb/>

    
Although she struggled to suppress her love,<lb/>
unable to restrain herself, she said,<lb/>
“In vain I've striven to subdue my heart:<lb/>
some god it must be, which I cannot tell,<lb/>
is working to destroy my hapless life;<lb/>
or else it is the burning flame of love<lb/>
that in me rages. If it is not love,<lb/>
why do the mandates of my father seem<lb/>
too harsh? They surely are too harsh. Why do<lb/>
I fear that he may perish whom I have<lb/>
seen only once? What is the secret cause<lb/>
that I am agitated by such fears?—<lb/>
It is no other than the god of Love.<lb/>

    
“Thrust from your virgin breast such burning flames<lb/>
and overcome their hot unhappiness—<lb/>
if I could do so, I should be myself:<lb/>
but some deluding power is holding me<lb/>
helpless against my will. Desire persuades<lb/>
me one way, but my reason still persuades<lb/>
another way. I see a better course<lb/>
and I approve, but follow its defeat. —<lb/>

    
“O royal maiden, why are you consumed<lb/>
with love for this strange man, and why are you<lb/>
so willing to be carried by the nuptial ties<lb/>
so far from your own country, where, indeed,<lb/>
are many brave men worthy of your love?<lb/>

    
“Whether for life or death his numbered hours<lb/>
are in the mercy of the living Gods,<lb/>
and that he may not suffer risk of death,<lb/>
too well foreseen, now let my prayers prevail—<lb/>
righteously uttered of a generous heart<lb/>
without the stress of love. What wicked thing<lb/>
has Jason done? His handsome person, youth,<lb/>
and noble ways, would move a heart of stone.<lb/>

    
“Have I a heart of flint, or was I born<lb/>
a tigress to deny him timely aid?—<lb/>
Unless I interpose, he will be slain<lb/>
by the hot breath of brazen-footed bulls,<lb/>
or will be slaughtered by the warriors, sprung<lb/>
miraculous from earth, or will be given<lb/>
to satisfy the ravenous appetite<lb/>
of a huge dragon.<lb/>

    
“Let my gloating eyes<lb/>
be satiate with his dying agonies!<lb/>
Let me incite the fury of these bulls!<lb/>
Stir to their blood-lust mad-born sons of Earth!<lb/>
Rouse up the never-sleeping dragon's rage!—<lb/>
“Avert it Gods!—<lb/>

    
“But why should I cry out<lb/>
upon the Gods to save him from such wrong,<lb/>
when, by my actions and my power, myself<lb/>
may shield him from all evils?<lb/>

    
“Such a course<lb/>
would wreck the kingdom of my father—and by me<lb/>
the wily stranger would escape from him;<lb/>
and spreading to the wind his ready sails<lb/>
he would forget and leave me to my fate.—<lb/>
Oh, if he should forget my sacrifice,<lb/>
and so prefer those who neglected him,<lb/>
let him then perish in his treachery.—<lb/>

    
“But these are idle thoughts: his countenance,<lb/>
reveals innate nobility and grace,<lb/>
that should dispel all fear of treachery,<lb/>
and guarantee his ever-faithful heart.<lb/>
The Gods will witness our united souls,<lb/>
and he shall pledge his faith. Secure of it<lb/>
my fear will be removed. Be ready, then—<lb/>
and make a virtue of necessity:<lb/>
your Jason owes himself to you; and he<lb/>
must join you in true wedlock. Then you shall<lb/>
be celebrated through the land of Greece,<lb/>
by throngs of women, for the man you saved.<lb/>

    
“Shall I then sail away, and so forsake<lb/>
my sister, brother, father, Gods, and land<lb/>
that gave me birth? My father is indeed<lb/>
a stern man, and my native land is all<lb/>
too barbarous; my brother is a child,—<lb/>
my sister's goodwill is good help for me;<lb/>
and heaven's supreme god is within my breast.<lb/>

    
“I shall not so be leaving valued hopes,<lb/>
but will be going surely to great things.<lb/>
And I should gain applause from all the world,<lb/>
as having saved the threatened Argonauts,<lb/>
most noble of the Greeks; and in their land,<lb/>
which certainly is better than my own,<lb/>
become the bride of Jason, for whose love<lb/>
I should not hesitate to give the world—<lb/>
and in whose love the living Gods rejoice<lb/>
so greatly; for his sake they would bestow<lb/>
their favors on my head, and make the stars<lb/>
my habitation.<lb/>

    
“Should I hesitate<lb/>
because the wreck-strewn mountains bar the way,<lb/>
and clash together in the Euxine waves;<lb/>
or fear Charybdis, fatal to large ships,<lb/>
that sucks the deep sea in its whirling gulf<lb/>
and spouts far upward, with alternate force,<lb/>
or Scylla, circled with infuriate hounds<lb/>
howling in rage from deep Sicilian waves?<lb/>

    
“Safe in the shielding arms of him I love,<lb/>
on Jason's bosom leaning, I shall be<lb/>
borne safely over wide and hostile seas;<lb/>
and in his dear embrace forget my fears—<lb/>
or if for anything I suffer dread,<lb/>
it will be only for the one I love.—<lb/>

    
“Alas, Medea, this vain argument<lb/>
has only furnished plausible excuse<lb/>
for criminal desires, and desecrates<lb/>
the marriage rite. It is a wicked thing<lb/>
to think upon. Before it is too late<lb/>
forget your passion and deny this guilt.”<lb/>

    
And after she had said these words, her eyes<lb/>
were opened to the prize of modesty,<lb/>
chaste virtue, and a pure affection:<lb/>
and Cupid, vanquished, turned away and fled.<lb/>

    
Then, to an ancient altar of the goddess named<lb/>
Hecate, Perse's daughter took her way<lb/>
in the deep shadows of a forest. She<lb/>
was strong of purpose now, and all the flames<lb/>
of vanquished passion had died down; but when<lb/>
she saw the son of Aeson, dying flames<lb/>
leaped up again. Her cheeks grew red, then all<lb/>
her face went pale again; as a small spark<lb/>
when hid beneath the ashes, if fed by<lb/>
a breath of wind grows and regains its strength,<lb/>
as it is fanned to life; so now her love<lb/>
that had been smoldering, and which you would<lb/>
have thought was almost dead, when she had see<lb/>
again his manly youth, blazed up once more.<lb/>

    
For on that day his graceful person seemed<lb/>
as glorious as a God;—and as she gazed,<lb/>
and fixed her eyes upon his countenance,<lb/>
her frenzy so prevailed, she was convinced<lb/>
that he was not a mortal. And her eyes<lb/>
were fascinated; and she could not turn<lb/>
away from him. But when he spoke to her,<lb/>
and promised marriage, grasping her right hand:<lb/>
she answered, as her eyes suffused with tears;<lb/>
“I see what I will do, and ignorance<lb/>
of truth will not be my undoing now,<lb/>
but love itself. By my assistance you<lb/>
shall be preserved; but when preserved fulfill<lb/>
your promise.”<lb/>

    
He swore that she could trust in him.<lb/>
Then by the goddess of the triple form,<lb/>
Diana, Trivia, or Luna called,<lb/>
and by her sacred groves and fanes, he vowed,<lb/>
and by the hallowed Sun that sees all things,<lb/>
and by his own adventures, and his life,—<lb/>
on these the youthful Jason took his oath.—<lb/>
With this she was assured and quickly gave<lb/>
to him the magic herbs: he learnt their use<lb/>
and full of joy withdrew into his house.<lb/>

    
Now when the dawn had dimmed the glittering stars,<lb/>
the people hastened to the sacred field<lb/>
of Mars, and on the hills expectant stood.—<lb/>
Arrayed in purple, and in majesty<lb/>
distinguished by his ivory sceptre, sat<lb/>
the king, surrounded by a multitude.<lb/>
Below them on the visioned Field of Mars,<lb/>
huge brazen-footed bulls were breathing forth<lb/>
from adamantine nostrils living flames,<lb/>
blasting the verdant herbage in their path!<lb/>

    
As forges glowing with hot flames resound,<lb/>
or as much quick-lime, burnt in earthen kilns,<lb/>
crackles and hisses as if mad with rage,<lb/>
sprinkled with water, liberating heat;<lb/>
so their hot throats and triple-heated sides,<lb/>
resounding told of pent-up fires within.<lb/>

    
The son of Aeson went to meet them. As<lb/>
he came to meet them the fierce animals<lb/>
turned on him faces terrible, and sharp<lb/>
horns tipped with iron, and they pawed<lb/>
the dusty earth with cloven feet, and filled<lb/>
the place with fiery bellowings. The Minyans<lb/>
were stark with fear; he went up to the bulls<lb/>
not feeling their hot breath at all, so great<lb/>
the power of his charmed drugs; and while he<lb/>
was stroking their down-hanging dewlaps with<lb/>
a fearless hand, he placed the yoke down on<lb/>
their necks and made them draw the heavy plow,<lb/>
and cut through fields that never felt the steel<lb/>
before. The Colchians were amazed and silent;<lb/>
but the loud shouting of the Minyans<lb/>
increased their hero's courage. Taking then<lb/>
the serpent's teeth out of a brazen helmet<lb/>
he sowed them broadcast in the new-plowed field.<lb/>

    
The moist earth softened these seeds that were steeped<lb/>
in virulent poison and the teeth swelled up<lb/>
and took new forms. And just as in its mother<lb/>
an infant gradually assumes the form<lb/>
of man, and is perfected through all parts<lb/>
within, and does not come forth to the light<lb/>
till fully formed; so, when the forms of men<lb/>
had been completed in the womb of earth<lb/>
made pregnant, they rose up from it,<lb/>
and what is yet more wonderful, each one<lb/>
clashed weapons that had been brought forth with him.<lb/>

    
When his companions saw the warriors turn<lb/>
as if with one accord, to hurl their spears,<lb/>
sharp-pointed, at the head of Jason, fear<lb/>
unnerved the boldest and their courage failed.<lb/>
So, too, the maid whose sorcery had saved<lb/>
him from much danger, when she saw the youth<lb/>
encompassed by those raging enemies,<lb/>
and he alone against so many—struck<lb/>
with sudden panic, she turned ashen white,<lb/>
her bloodless cheeks were blanched; and chilled with fear<lb/>
she wilted to the ground; and lest the herbs,<lb/>
so lately given him, might fail his need<lb/>
she added incantations and invoked<lb/>
mysterious arts. While she protected him<lb/>

    
He seized upon a heavy stone, and hurled<lb/>
it in the midst of his new enemies—<lb/>
distracted by this cast, and murderous,<lb/>
they turned from him, and clashing their new arms,<lb/>
those earth-born brothers fought among themselves<lb/>
till all were slaughtered in blood-thirsty strife.<lb/>

    
Gladly the Greeks acclaimed him conqueror,<lb/>
and pressed around him for the first embrace.<lb/>
Then, too, Medea, barbarous Colchian maid,<lb/>
although her modesty restrained her heart,<lb/>
eagerly longed to fold him in her arms,<lb/>
but careful of her good name, held aloof,—<lb/>
rejoicing in deep, silent love; and she<lb/>
acknowledged to the Gods her mighty gift<lb/>
of incantations.<lb/>

    
But the dragon, still<lb/>
alert,—magnificent and terrible<lb/>
with gorgeous crest and triple tongue, and fangs<lb/>
barbed as a javelin, guards the Golden Fleece:<lb/>
and Jason can obtain that quest only<lb/>
if slumber may seal up the monster's eyes.—<lb/>

    
Jason, successful, sprinkled on his crest<lb/>
Lethean juices of a magic herb,<lb/>
and then recited thrice the words which bring<lb/>
deep slumber, potent words which would becalm<lb/>
the storm-tossed ocean, and would stop the flow<lb/>
of the most rapid rivers of our earth:<lb/>
and slowly slumber sealed the dragon's eyes.<lb/>

    
While that great monster slept, the hero took<lb/>
the Golden Fleece; and proudly sailed away<lb/>
bearing his treasure and the willing maid,<lb/>
(whose aid had saved him) to his native port<lb/>
Iolcus—victorious with the Argonauts.<lb/>


Aeson.
REJUVENATION OF AESON

Now when the valiant Argonauts returned<lb/>
to Thessaly, their happy relatives,<lb/>
fathers and mothers, praised the living Gods;<lb/>
and with their hallowed gifts enhanced the flames<lb/>
with precious incense; and they offered Jove<lb/>
a sacred bullock, rich with gilded horns.<lb/>

    
But Jason's father, Aeson, came not down<lb/>
rejoicing to behold his son, for now<lb/>
worn out with many years, he waited death.<lb/>
And Jason to Medea grieving said:<lb/>

    
“Dearest, to whom my life and love are due,<lb/>
although your kindness has been great to me,<lb/>
and you have granted more than I should ask,<lb/>
yet one thing more I beg of you; if your<lb/>
enchantments can accomplish my desire,<lb/>
take from my life some years that I should live<lb/>
and add them to my father's ending days.”—<lb/>
And as he spoke he could not check his tears.<lb/>

    
Medea, moved by his affection, thought<lb/>
how much less she had grieved for her loved sire:<lb/>
and she replied:—“A wicked thing you ask!<lb/>
Can I be capable of using you<lb/>
in such a manner as to take your life<lb/>
and give it to another? Ask not me<lb/>
a thing so dreadful! May the Gods forbid!—<lb/>
I will endeavor to perform for you<lb/>
a task much greater. By the powers of Night<lb/>
I will most certainly return to him<lb/>
the lost years of your father, but must not<lb/>
deprive you of your own. — Oh grant the power,<lb/>
great goddess of the triple form, that I<lb/>
may fail not to accomplish this great deed!”<lb/>

    
Three nights were wanting for the moon to join<lb/>
her circling horns and form a perfect orb.<lb/>
When these were passed, the rounded light shone full<lb/>
and bright upon the earth.—Through the still night<lb/>
alone, Medea stole forth from the house<lb/>
with feet bare, and in flowing garment clothed—<lb/>
her long hair unadorned and not confined.<lb/>
Deep slumber has relaxed the world, and all<lb/>
that's living, animals and birds and men,<lb/>
and even the hedges and the breathing leaves<lb/>
are still—and motionless the laden air.<lb/>

    
Only the stars are twinkling, and to them<lb/>
she looks and beckons with imploring hands.<lb/>
Now thrice around she paces, and three times<lb/>
besprinkles her long hair with water dipt<lb/>
from crystal streams, which having done<lb/>
she kneels a moment on the cold, bare ground,<lb/>
and screaming three times calls upon the Night,—<lb/>

    
“O faithful Night, regard my mysteries!<lb/>
O golden-lighted Stars! O softly-moving Moon—<lb/>
genial, your fire succeeds the heated day!<lb/>
O Hecate! grave three-faced queen of these<lb/>
charms of enchanters and enchanters, arts!<lb/>
O fruitful Earth, giver of potent herbs!<lb/>
O gentle Breezes and destructive Winds!<lb/>
You Mountains, Rivers, Lakes and sacred Groves,<lb/>
and every dreaded god of silent Night!<lb/>
Attend upon me!—<lb/>

    
“When my power commands,<lb/>
the rivers turn from their accustomed ways<lb/>
and roll far backward to their secret springs!<lb/>
I speak—and the wild, troubled sea is calm,<lb/>
and I command the waters to arise!<lb/>
The clouds I scatter—and I bring the clouds;<lb/>
I smooth the winds and ruffle up their rage;<lb/>
I weave my spells and I recite my charms;<lb/>
I pluck the fangs of serpents, and I move<lb/>
the living rocks and twist the rooted oaks;<lb/>
I blast the forests. Mountains at my word<lb/>
tremble and quake; and from her granite tombs<lb/>
the liberated ghosts arise as Earth<lb/>
astonished groans! From your appointed ways,<lb/>
O wonder-working Moon, I draw you down<lb/>
against the magic-making sound of gongs<lb/>
and brazen vessels of Temesa's ore;<lb/>
I cast my spells and veil the jeweled rays<lb/>
of Phoebus' wain, and quench Aurora's fires.<lb/>

    
“At my command you tamed the flaming bulls<lb/>
which long disdained to bend beneath the yoke,<lb/>
until they pressed their necks against the plows;<lb/>
and, subject to my will, you raised up war<lb/>
till the strong company of dragon-birth<lb/>
were slaughtered as they fought amongst themselves;<lb/>
and, last, you lulled asleep the warden's eyes—<lb/>
guards of the Golden Fleece—till then awake<lb/>
and sleeping never—so, deceiving him,<lb/>
you sent the treasure to the Grecian cities!<lb/>

    
“Witness my need of super-natured herbs,<lb/>
elixirs potent to renew the years of age,<lb/>
giving the bloom of youth.—You shall not fail<lb/>
to grant me this; for not in vain the stars<lb/>
are flashing confirmation; not in vain<lb/>
the flying dragons, harnessed by their necks,<lb/>
from skies descending bring my chariot down.”<lb/>

    
A chariot, sent from heaven, came to her—<lb/>
and soon as she had stroked the dragons' necks,<lb/>
and shaken in her hands the guiding reins—<lb/>
as soon as she had mounted, she was borne<lb/>
quickly above, through unresisting air.<lb/>
And, sailing over Thessaly, she saw<lb/>
the vale of Tempe, where the level soil<lb/>
is widely covered with a crumbling chalk—<lb/>
she turned her dragons towards new regions there:<lb/>
and she observed the herbs by Ossa born,<lb/>
the weeds on lofty Pelion, Othrys, Pindus<lb/>
and vast Olympus—and from here she plucked<lb/>
the needed roots, or there, the blossoms clipped<lb/>
all with a moon-curved sickle made of brass—<lb/>
many the wild weeds by Apidanus,<lb/>
as well as blue Amphrysus' banks, she chose,<lb/>
and not escaped Enipeus from her search;<lb/>
Peneian stretches and Spercheian banks<lb/>
all yielded what she chose:—and Boebe's shore<lb/>
where sway the rushes; and she plucked up grass,<lb/>
a secret grass, from fair Euboean fields<lb/>

    
life-giving virtues in their waving blades,<lb/>
as yet unknown for transformation wrought<lb/>
on Glaucus.<lb/>

    
All those fields she visited,<lb/>
with ceaseless diligence in quest of charms,<lb/>
nine days and nine nights sought strong herbs,<lb/>
and the swift dragons with their active wings,<lb/>
failed not to guide the chariot where she willed—<lb/>
until they reached her home. The dragons then<lb/>
had not been even touched by anything,<lb/>
except the odor of surrounding herbs,<lb/>
and yet they sloughed their skins, the growth of years.<lb/>


    
She would not cross the threshold of her home<lb/>
nor pass its gates; but, standing in the field,<lb/>
alone beneath the canopy of Heaven,<lb/>
she shunned all contact with her husband, while<lb/>
she built up from the ever-living turf<lb/>
two altars, one of which upon the right<lb/>
to Hecate was given, but the one<lb/>
upon the left was sacred then to you,<lb/>
O Hebe, goddess of eternal youth!<lb/>

    
Festooning woodland boughs and sweet vervain<lb/>
adorned these altars, near by which she dug<lb/>
as many trenches. Then, when all was done,<lb/>
she slaughtered a black ram, and sprinkled with blood<lb/>
the thirsty trenches; after which she poured<lb/>
from rich carchesian goblets generous wine<lb/>
and warm milk, grateful to propitious Gods—<lb/>
the Deities of earth on whom she called—<lb/>
entreating, as she did so, Pluto, lord<lb/>
of ghostly shades, and ravished Proserpine,<lb/>
that they should not, in undue haste,<lb/>
deprive her patient's aged limbs of life.<lb/>

    
When certain she compelled the God's regard,<lb/>
assured her incantations and long prayers<lb/>
were both approved and heard, she bade her people<lb/>
bring out the body of her father-in-law—<lb/>
old Aeson's worn out body—and when she<lb/>
had buried him in a deep slumber by<lb/>
her spells, as if he were a dead man, she<lb/>
then stretched him out upon a bed of herbs.<lb/>

    
She ordered Jason and his servants thence,<lb/>
and warned them not to spy upon her rites,<lb/>
with eyes profane. As soon as they retired,<lb/>
Medea, with disheveled hair and wild<lb/>
abandon, as a Bacchanalian, paced<lb/>
times three around the blazing altars, while<lb/>
she dipped her torches, splintered at the top,<lb/>
into the trenches, dark: with blood, and lit<lb/>
the dipt ends in the sacred altar flames.<lb/>
Times three she purified the ancient man<lb/>
with flames, and thrice with water, and three times<lb/>
with sulphur,—as the boiling mixture seethed<lb/>
and bubbled in the brazen cauldron near.<lb/>

    
And into this, acerbic juices, roots,<lb/>
and flowers and seeds—from vales Hemonian—<lb/>
and mixed elixirs, into which she cast<lb/>
stones of strange virtue from the Orient,<lb/>
and sifted sands of ebbing ocean's tide;<lb/>
white hoar-frost, gathered when the moon was full,<lb/>
the nauseating flesh and luckless wings<lb/>
of the uncanny screech-owl, and the entrails<lb/>
from a mysterious animal that changed<lb/>
from wolf to man, from man to wolf again;<lb/>
the scaly sloughing of a water-snake,<lb/>
the medic liver of a long-lived stag,<lb/>
and the hard beak and head of an old crow<lb/>
which was alive nine centuries before;<lb/>
these, and a thousand nameless things<lb/>
the foreign sorceress prepared and mixed,<lb/>
and blended all together with a branch<lb/>
of peaceful olive, old and dry with years. —<lb/>
And while she stirred the withered olive branch<lb/>
in the hot mixture, it began to change<lb/>
from brown to green; and presently put forth<lb/>
new leaves, and soon was heavy with a wealth<lb/>
of luscious olives.—As the ever-rising fire<lb/>
threw bubbling froth beyond the cauldron's rim,<lb/>
the ground was covered with fresh verdure — flowers<lb/>
and all luxuriant grasses, and green plants.<lb/>

    
Medea, when she saw this wonder took<lb/>
her unsheathed knife and cut the old man's throat;<lb/>
then, letting all his old blood out of him<lb/>
she filled his ancient veins with rich elixir.<lb/>
As he received it through his lips or wound,<lb/>
his beard and hair no longer white with age,<lb/>
turned quickly to their natural vigor, dark<lb/>
and lustrous; and his wasted form renewed,<lb/>
appeared in all the vigor of bright youth,<lb/>
no longer lean and sallow, for new blood<lb/>
coursed in his well-filled veins.—Astonished, when<lb/>
released from his deep sleep, and strong in youth,<lb/>
his memory assured him, such he was<lb/>
years four times ten before that day!—<lb/>

    
Bacchus, from his celestial vantage saw<lb/>
this marvel, and convinced his nurses might<lb/>
then all regain their former vigor, he<lb/>
pled with Medea to restore their youth.<lb/>
The Colchian woman granted his request.<lb/>


Pelias.
MEDEA AND PELIAS

but so her malice might be satisfied<lb/>
Medea feigned she had a quarrel with<lb/>
her husband, and for safety she had fled<lb/>
to Pelias. There, since the king himself<lb/>
was heavy with old age, his daughters gave<lb/>
her generous reception. And these girls<lb/>
the shrewd Medea in a short time won,<lb/>
by her false show of friendliness; and while<lb/>
among the most remarkable of her<lb/>
achievements she was telling how she had<lb/>
rejuvenated Aeson, and she dwelt<lb/>
particularly, on that strange event,<lb/>
these daughters were induced to hope that by<lb/>
some skill like this their father might regain<lb/>
his lost youth also. And they begged of her<lb/>
this boon, persuading her to name the price;<lb/>
no matter if it was large. She did not<lb/>
reply at once and seemed to hesitate,<lb/>
and so she held their fond minds in a deep<lb/>
suspense by her feigned meditation. When<lb/>
she had at length declared she would restore<lb/>
his youth, she said to them: “That you may have<lb/>
strong confidence in this my promised boon,<lb/>
the oldest leader of your flock of sheep shall be<lb/>
changed to a lamb again by my prized drugs.”<lb/>

    
Straightway a wooly ram, worn out with length<lb/>
of untold years was brought, his great horns curved<lb/>
around his hollow temples. After she<lb/>
had cut his scrawny throat with her sharp knife<lb/>
Thessalian, barely staining it with his<lb/>
thin blood, Medea plunged his carcass in<lb/>
a bronze-made kettle, throwing in it at<lb/>
the same time juices of great potency.<lb/>
These made his body shrink and burnt away<lb/>
his two horns, and with horns his years. And now<lb/>
thin bleating was heard from within the pot;<lb/>
and even while they wondered at the sound,<lb/>
a lamb jumped out and frisking, ran away<lb/>
to find some udder with its needed milk.<lb/>

    
Amazed the daughters looked on and, now that<lb/>
these promises had been performed, they urged<lb/>
more eagerly their first request. Three times<lb/>
Phoebus unyoked his steeds after their plunge<lb/>
in Ebro's stream, and on the fourth night stars<lb/>
shown brilliant on the dark foil of the sky,<lb/>
and then the treacherous daughter of Aeetes<lb/>
set some clear water over a hot fire<lb/>
and put in it herbs of no potency.<lb/>
And now a death-like sleep held the king down,<lb/>
his body all relaxed, and with the king<lb/>
his guards, a sleep which incantations with<lb/>
the potency of magic words had given.<lb/>

    
The sad king's daughters, as they had been bid,<lb/>
were in his room, and with Medea stood<lb/>
around his bed. “Why do you hesitate,”<lb/>
Medea said. “You laggards, come and draw<lb/>
your swords; let out his old blood that<lb/>
I may refill his empty veins again<lb/>
with young blood. In your hands your father's life<lb/>
and youth are resting. You, his daughters, must<lb/>
have love for him, and if the hopes you have<lb/>
are not all vain, come, do your duty by<lb/>
your father; drive out old age at the point<lb/>
of your good weapons; and let out his blood<lb/>
enfeebled—cure him with the stroke of iron.”<lb/>

    
Spurred on by these words, as each one of them<lb/>
was filial she became the leader in<lb/>
the most unfilial act, and that she might<lb/>
not be most wicked did the wicked deed.<lb/>
Not one could bear to see her own blows, so<lb/>
they turned their eyes away; and every face<lb/>
averted so, they blindly struck him with<lb/>
their cruel hands. The old man streaming with<lb/>
his blood, still raised himself on elbow, and<lb/>
half mangled tried to get up from his bed;<lb/>
with all those swords around him, he stretched out<lb/>
his pale arms and he cried: “What will you do,<lb/>
my daughters? What has armed you to the death<lb/>
of your loved father?” Their wrong courage left<lb/>
them, and their hands fell. When he would have said<lb/>
still more, Medea cut his throat and plunged<lb/>
his mangled body into boiling water.<lb/>


Medeae fuga.

Only because her winged dragons sailed<lb/>
swiftly with her up to the lofty sky,<lb/>
escaped Medea punishment for this<lb/>
unheard of crime.<lb/>

    
Her chariot sailed above<lb/>
embowered Pelion — long the lofty home<lb/>
of Chiron—over Othrys, and the vale<lb/>
made famous where Cerambus met his fate.<lb/>
Cerambus, by the aid of nymphs, from there<lb/>
was wafted through the air on wings, when earth<lb/>
was covered by the overwhelming sea—<lb/>
and so escaped Deucalion's flood, uncrowned.<lb/>

    
She passed by Pittane upon the left,<lb/>
with its huge serpent-image of hard stone,<lb/>
and also passed the grove called Ida's, where<lb/>
the stolen bull was changed by Bacchus' power<lb/>
into a hunted stag—in that same vale<lb/>
Paris lies buried in the sand; and over fields<lb/>
where Mera warning harked, Medea flew;<lb/>
over the city of Eurypylus<lb/>
upon the Isle of Cos, whose women wore<lb/>
the horns of cattle when from there had gone<lb/>
the herd of Hercules; and over Rhodes<lb/>
beloved of Phoebus, where Telchinian tribes<lb/>
dwelt, whose bad eyes corrupting power shot forth;—<lb/>
Jove, utterly despising, thrust them deep<lb/>
beneath his brother's waves; over the walls<lb/>
of old Carthaea, where Alcidamas<lb/>
had seen with wonder a tame dove arise<lb/>
from his own daughter's body.<lb/>

    
And she saw<lb/>
the lakes of Hyrie in Teumesia's Vale,<lb/>
by swans frequented—There to satisfy<lb/>
his love for Cycnus, Phyllius gave<lb/>
two living vultures: shell for him subdued<lb/>
a lion, and delivered it to him;<lb/>
and mastered a great bull, at his command;<lb/>
but when the wearied Phyllius refused<lb/>
to render to his friend the valued bull.<lb/>
Indignant, the youth said, “You shall regret<lb/>
your hasty words;” which having said, he leaped<lb/>
from a high precipice, as if to death;<lb/>
but gliding through the air, on snow-white wings,<lb/>
was changed into a swan—Dissolved in tears,<lb/>
his mother Hyrie knew not he was saved;<lb/>
and weeping, formed the lake that bears her name.<lb/>

    
And over Pleuron, where on trembling wings<lb/>
escaped the mother Combe from her sons,<lb/>
Medea flew; and over the far isle<lb/>
Calauria, sacred to Latona.—She<lb/>
beheld the conscious fields whose lawful king,<lb/>
together with his queen were changed to birds.<lb/>

    
Upon her right Cyllene could be seen;<lb/>
there Menephon, degraded as a beast,<lb/>
outraged his mother. In the distance, she<lb/>
beheld Cephisius, who lamented long<lb/>
his hapless grandson, by Apollo changed<lb/>
into a bloated sea-calf. And she saw<lb/>
the house where king Eumelus mourned the death<lb/>
of his aspiring son.—Borne on the wings<lb/>
of her enchanted dragons, she arrived<lb/>
at Corinth, whose inhabitants, 'tis said,<lb/>
from many mushrooms, watered by the rain<lb/>
sprang into being.<lb/>

    
There she spent some years.<lb/>
But after the new wife had been burnt by<lb/>
the Colchian witchcraft and two seas<lb/>
had seen the king's own palace all aflame,<lb/>
then, savagely she drew her sword, and bathed<lb/>
it in the blood of her own infant sons;<lb/>
by which atrocious act she was revenged;<lb/>
and she, a wife and mother, fled the sword<lb/>
of her own husband, Jason.<lb/>

MEDEA AND AEGEUS

On the wings<lb/>
of her enchanted Titan Dragons borne,<lb/>
she made escape, securely, nor delayed<lb/>
until she entered the defended walls<lb/>
of great Minerva's city, at the hour<lb/>
when aged Periphas — transformed by Jove,<lb/>
together with his queen, on eagle wings<lb/>
flew over its encircling walls: with whom<lb/>
the guilty Halcyone, skimming seas<lb/>
safely escaped, upon her balanced wings.<lb/>

    
And after these events, Medea went<lb/>
to Aegeus, king of Athens, where she found<lb/>
protection from her enemies for all<lb/>
this evil done. With added wickedness<lb/>
Aegeus, after that, united her<lb/>
to him in marriage.—<lb/>


Theseus.

All unknown to him<lb/>
came Theseus to his kingly court.—Before<lb/>
the time his valor had established peace<lb/>
on all the isthmus, raved by dual seas.<lb/>

    
Medea, seeking his destruction, brewed<lb/>
the juice of aconite, infesting shores<lb/>
of Scythia, where, 'tis fabled, the plant grew<lb/>
on soil infected by Cerberian teeth.<lb/>

    
There is a gloomy entrance to a cave,<lb/>
that follows a declivitous descent:<lb/>
there Hercules with chains of adamant<lb/>
dragged from the dreary edge of Tartarus<lb/>
that monster-watch-dog, Cerberus, which, vain<lb/>
opposing, turned his eyes aslant from light—<lb/>
from dazzling day. Delirious, enraged,<lb/>
that monster shook the air with triple howls;<lb/>
and, frothing, sprinkled as it raved, the fields,<lb/>
once green—with spewing of white poison-foam.<lb/>
And this, converted into plants, sucked up<lb/>
a deadly venom with the nourishment<lb/>
of former soils,—from which productive grew<lb/>
upon the rock, thus formed, the noxious plant;<lb/>
by rustics, from that cause, named aconite.<lb/>

    
Medea worked on Aegeus to present<lb/>
his own son, Theseus, with a deadly cup<lb/>
of aconite; prevailing by her art<lb/>
so that he deemed his son an enemy.<lb/>

    
Theseus unwittingly received the cup,<lb/>
but just before he touched it to his lips,<lb/>
his father recognized the sword he wore,<lb/>
for, graven on its ivory hilt was wrought<lb/>
a known device—the token of his race.<lb/>
Astonished, Aegeus struck the poison-cup<lb/>
from his devoted son's confiding lips.<lb/>
Medea suddenly escaped from death,<lb/>
in a dark whirlwind her witch-singing raised.<lb/>

THE MYRMIDONS

Recoiling from such utter wickedness,<lb/>
rejoicing that his son escaped from death,<lb/>
the grateful father kindled altar-fires,<lb/>
and gave rich treasure to the living Gods. —<lb/>
He slaughtered scores of oxen, decked with flowers<lb/>
and gilded horns. The sun has never shone<lb/>
upon a day more famous in that land,<lb/>
for all the elders and the common folk<lb/>
united in festivities,—with wine<lb/>
inspiring wit and song;—“O you,” they sang,<lb/>

    
“Immortal Theseus, victory was yours!<lb/>
Did you not slaughter the huge bull of Crete?<lb/>

    
“Yes, you did slay the boar of Cromyon —<lb/>
where now the peasant unmolested plows;<lb/>

    
“And Periphetes, wielder of the club,<lb/>
was worsted when he struggled with your strength;<lb/>

    
“And fierce Procrustes, matched with you<lb/>
beside the rapid river, met his death;<lb/>

    
“And even Cercyon, in Eleusis lost<lb/>
his wicked life—inferior to your might;<lb/>

    
“And Sinis, a monstrosity of strength,<lb/>
who bent the trunks of trees, and used his might<lb/>

    
“Against the world for everything that's wrong.<lb/>
For evil, he would force down to the earth,<lb/>

    
“Pine tops to shoot men's bodies through the air.<lb/>
Even the road to Megara is safe,<lb/>

    
“For you did hurl the robber Scyron,—sheer—<lb/>
over the cliff. Both land and sea denied<lb/>

    
“His bones a resting place—as tossed about<lb/>
they changed into the cliffs that bear his name.<lb/>

    
“How can we tell the number of your deeds,—<lb/>
deeds glorious, that now exceed your years!<lb/>

    
“For you, brave hero, we give public thanks<lb/>
and prayers; to you we drain our cups of wine!”<lb/>

    
And all the palace rings with happy songs,<lb/>
and with the grateful prayers of all the people.<lb/>
And sorrow in that city is not known.—<lb/>


Aeacus. Pestilentia. Myrmidones.

But pleasure always is alloyed with grief,<lb/>
and sorrow mingles in the joyous hour.<lb/>

    
While the king Aegeus and his son rejoiced,<lb/>
Minos prepared for war. He was invincible<lb/>
in men and ships—and stronger in his rage<lb/>
to wreak due vengeance on the king who slew<lb/>
his son Androgeus. But first he sought<lb/>
some friends to aid his warfare; and he scoured<lb/>
the sea with a swift fleet—which was his strength.<lb/>
Anaphe and Astypalaea, both<lb/>
agreed to join his cause—the first one moved<lb/>
by promises, the second by his threats.<lb/>
Level Myconus and the chalky fields<lb/>
of Cimolus agreed to aid, and Syros<lb/>
covered with wild thyme, level Seriphos,<lb/>
Paros of marble cliffs, and that place which<lb/>
Arne the impious Siphnian had betrayed,<lb/>
who having got the gold which in her greed<lb/>
she had demanded, was changed to a bird<lb/>
which ever since that day imagines gold<lb/>
its chief delight—a black-foot black-winged daw.<lb/>

    
But Oliarus, Didymae, and Tenos,<lb/>
Gyaros, Andros, and Peparethos<lb/>
rich in its glossy olives, gave no aid<lb/>
to the strong Cretan fleet. Sailing from them<lb/>
Minos went to Oenopia, known realm<lb/>
of the Aeacidae.—Men of old time<lb/>
had called the place Oenopia; but Aeacus<lb/>
styled it Aegina from his mother's name.<lb/>
At his approach an eager rabble rushed<lb/>
resolved to see and know so great a man.<lb/>
Telamon met him, and his brother,<lb/>
younger than Telamon, and Phocus who<lb/>
was third in age. Even Aeacus appeared,<lb/>
slow with the weight of years, and asked him what<lb/>
could be a reason for his coming there.<lb/>
The ruler of a hundred cities, sighed,<lb/>
as he beheld the sons of Aeacus,<lb/>
for they reminded him of his lost son;—<lb/>
and heavy with his sorrow, he replied:<lb/>
“I come imploring you to take up arms,<lb/>
and aid me in the war against my foes;<lb/>
for I must give that comfort to the shade<lb/>
of my misfortuned son—whose blood they shed.”<lb/>

    
But Aeacus replied to Minos, “Nay,<lb/>
it is a vain request you make, for we<lb/>
are bound in strict alliance to the land<lb/>
and people of Cecropia.”<lb/>

    
Full of rage,<lb/>
because he was denied, the king of Crete,<lb/>
Minos, as he departed from their shores<lb/>
replied, “Let such a treaty be your bane.”<lb/>
And he departed with his crafty threat,<lb/>
believing it expedient not to waste<lb/>
his power in wars until the proper time.<lb/>

    
Before the ships of Crete had disappeared,<lb/>
before the mist and blue of waves concealed<lb/>
their fading outlines from the anxious throng<lb/>
which gathered on Oenopian shores, a ship<lb/>
of Athens covered with wide sails appeared,<lb/>
and anchored safely by their friendly shore;<lb/>
and, presently, the mighty Cephalus,<lb/>
well known through all that nation for his deeds,<lb/>
addressed them as he landed, and declared<lb/>
the good will of his people. Him the sons<lb/>
of Aeacus remembered well, although<lb/>
they had not seen him for some untold years.<lb/>
They led him to their father's welcome home;<lb/>
and with him, also, his two comrades went,<lb/>
Clytus and Butes.<lb/>

    
Center of all eyes,<lb/>
the hero still retained his charm,<lb/>
the customary greetings were exchanged,<lb/>
the graceful hero, bearing in his hands<lb/>
a branch of olive from his native soil,<lb/>
delivered the Athenian message, which<lb/>
requested aid and offered for their thought<lb/>
the treaty and the ancestral league between<lb/>
their nations. And he added, Minos sought<lb/>
not only conquest of the Athenian state<lb/>
but sovereignty of all the states of Greece.<lb/>
And when this eloquence had shown his cause;<lb/>
with left hand on his gleaming sceptre's hilt,<lb/>
King Aeacus exclaimed: “Ask not our aid,<lb/>
but take it, Athens; and count boldly yours<lb/>
all of the force this island holds, and all<lb/>
things which the state of my affairs supplies.<lb/>
My strength for this war is not light, and I<lb/>
have many soldiers for myself and for<lb/>
my enemy. Thanks to the Gods! the times<lb/>
are happy, giving no excuse for my<lb/>
refusal.” “May it prove so,” Cephalus<lb/>
replied, “and may your city multiply<lb/>
in men: just now as I was landing, I<lb/>
rejoiced to meet youths, fair and matched in age.<lb/>
And yet I miss among them many whom<lb/>
I saw before when last I visited<lb/>
your city.” Aeacus then groaned and with<lb/>
sad voice replied: “With weeping we began,<lb/>
but better fortune followed. Would that I<lb/>
could tell the last of it, and not the first!<lb/>
Giving my heart command that simple words<lb/>
and briefly spoken may not long detain.<lb/>
Those happy youths who waited at your need,<lb/>
who smiled upon you and for whom you ask,<lb/>
because their absence grieves your noble mind,<lb/>
they've perished! and their bleaching bones<lb/>
or scattered ashes, only may remain,<lb/>
sad remnants, impotent, of vanished power,<lb/>
so recently my hope and my resource.<lb/>

    
“Because this island bears a rival's name,<lb/>
a deadly pestilence was visited<lb/>
on my confiding people, through the rage<lb/>
of jealous Juno flaming for revenge.<lb/>
This great calamity at first appeared<lb/>
a natural disease—but soon its power<lb/>
baffled our utmost efforts. Medicines<lb/>
availing not, a reign of terror swept<lb/>
from shore to shore and fearful havoc raged.<lb/>

    
“Thick darkness, gathered from descending skies,<lb/>
enveloped our devoted land with heat<lb/>
and languid sickness, for the space of full<lb/>
four moons.—Four times the Moon increased her size.<lb/>
Hot south winds blew with pestilential breath<lb/>
upon us. At the same time the diseased<lb/>
infection reached our needed springs and pools,<lb/>
thousands of serpents crawling over our<lb/>
deserted fields, defiled our rivers with<lb/>
their poison. The swift power of the disease<lb/>
at first was limited to death of dogs<lb/>
and birds and cattle, or among wild beasts.<lb/>
The luckless plowman marvels when he sees<lb/>
his strong bulls fall while at their task<lb/>
and sink down in the furrow. Woolly flocks<lb/>
bleat feebly while their wool falls off without<lb/>
a cause, and while their bodies pine away.<lb/>
The prized horse of high courage, and of great<lb/>
renown when on the race-course, has now lost<lb/>
victorious spirit, and forgetting his<lb/>
remembered glory groans in his shut stall,<lb/>
doomed for inglorious death. The boar forgets<lb/>
to rage, the stag to trust his speed; and even<lb/>
the famished bear to fight the stronger herd.<lb/>

    
“Death seizes on the vitals of all life;<lb/>
and in the woods, and in the fields and roads<lb/>
the loathsome bodies of the dead corrupt<lb/>
the heavy-hanging air. Even the dogs,<lb/>
the vultures and the wolves refuse to touch<lb/>
the putrid flesh, there in the sultry sun<lb/>
rotting upon the earth; emitting steams,<lb/>
and exhalations, with a baneful sweep<lb/>
increasing the dread contagion's wide extent.<lb/>


    
So spreading, with renewed destruction gained<lb/>
from its own poison, the fierce pestilence<lb/>
appeared to leap from moulding carcases<lb/>
of all the brute creation, till it struck<lb/>
the wretched tillers of the soil, and then<lb/>
extended its dominion over all<lb/>
this mighty city.<lb/>

    
“Always it began<lb/>
as if the patient's bowels were scorched with flames;<lb/>
red blotches on the body next appeared,<lb/>
and sharp pains in the lungs prevented breath.<lb/>
The swollen tongue would presently loll out,<lb/>
rough and discolored from the gaping mouth,<lb/>
wide-gasping to inhale the noxious air—<lb/>
and show red throbbing veins. The softest bed.<lb/>
And richest covering gave to none relief;<lb/>
but rather, the diseased would bare himself<lb/>
to cool his burning breast upon the ground,<lb/>
only to heat the earth—and no relief<lb/>
returned. And no physician could be found;<lb/>
for those who ministered among the sick<lb/>
were first to suffer from the dread disease—<lb/>
the cruel malady broke out upon<lb/>
the very ones who offered remedies.<lb/>
The hallowed art of medicine became<lb/>
a deadly snare to those who knew it best.<lb/>

    
“The only safety was in flight; and those<lb/>
who were the nearest to the stricken ones,<lb/>
and who most faithfully observed their wants,<lb/>
were always first to suffer as their wards.<lb/>

    
“And many, certain of approaching death,<lb/>
indulged their wicked passions—recklessly<lb/>
abandoned and without the sense of shame,<lb/>
promiscuously huddled by the wells,<lb/>
and rivers and cool fountains; but their thirst<lb/>
no water could assuage, and death alone<lb/>
was able to extinguish their desire.<lb/>
Too weak to rise, they die in water they<lb/>
pollute, while others drink its death.<lb/>

    
“A madness seizing on them made their beds<lb/>
become most irksome to their tortured nerves.<lb/>
Demented they could not endure the pain,<lb/>
and leaped insanely forth. Or if too weak,<lb/>
the wretches rolled their bodies on the ground,<lb/>
insistent to escape from hated homes—<lb/>
imagined sources of calamity;<lb/>
for, since the cause was hidden and unknown,<lb/>
the horrible locality was blamed.<lb/>
Suspicion seizes on each frail presence<lb/>
as proof of what can never be resolved.<lb/>

    
“And many half-dead wretches staggered out<lb/>
on sultry roads as long as they could stand;<lb/>
and others weeping, stretched out on the ground,<lb/>
died in convulsions, as their rolling eyes<lb/>
gazed upwards at the overhanging clouds;<lb/>
under the sad stars they breathed out their souls.<lb/>

    
“And oh, the deep despair that seized on me,<lb/>
the sovereign of that wretched people! I<lb/>
was tortured with a passionate desire<lb/>
to die the same death—And I hated life.<lb/>

    
“No matter where my shrinking eyes were turned,<lb/>
I saw a multitude of gruesome forms<lb/>
in ghastly attitudes bestrew the ground,<lb/>
scattered as rotten apples that have dropped<lb/>
from moving branches, or as acorns thick<lb/>
around a gnarled oak.<lb/>

    
“Lift up your eyes!<lb/>
Behold that holy temple! unto Jove<lb/>
long dedicated!—What availed the prayers<lb/>
of frightened multitudes, or incense burned<lb/>
on those devoted altars?—In the midst<lb/>
of his most fervent supplications,<lb/>
the husband as he pled for his dear wife,<lb/>
or the fond father for his stricken son,<lb/>
would suddenly, before a word prevailed,<lb/>
die clutching at the altars of his Gods,<lb/>
while holding in his stiffened hand, a spray<lb/>
of frankincense still waiting for the fire.<lb/>
How often sacrificial bulls have been<lb/>
brought to those temples, and while white-robed priest<lb/>
was pouring offered wine between their horns,<lb/>
have fallen without waiting for the stroke.<lb/>

    
“While I prepared a sacrifice to Jove,<lb/>
for my behalf, my country and three sons,<lb/>
the victim, ever moaning dismal sounds,<lb/>
before a blow was struck, fell suddenly<lb/>
beside the altar; and his scanty blood<lb/>
ran thinly from the knives that slaughtered him.<lb/>
His entrails, wanting all the marks of truth<lb/>
were so diseased, the warnings of the Gods<lb/>
could not be read—the baneful malady<lb/>
had penetrated to the heart of life.<lb/>

    
“And I have seen the carcases of men<lb/>
lie rotting at the sacred temple gates,<lb/>
or by the very altars, where they fell,<lb/>
making death odious to the living Gods.<lb/>
And often I have seen some desperate man<lb/>
end life by his own halter, and so cheat<lb/>
by voluntary death his fear of death,<lb/>
in mad haste to outrun approaching fate.<lb/>

    
“The bodies of the dead, indecently<lb/>
were cast forth, lacking sacred funeral rites<lb/>
as hitherto the custom. All the gates<lb/>
were crowded with processions of the dead.<lb/>
Unburied, they might lie upon the ground,<lb/>
or else, deserted, on their lofty pyres<lb/>
with no one to lament their dismal end,<lb/>
dissolve in their dishonored ashes. All<lb/>
restraint forgotten, a mad rabble fought<lb/>
and took possession of the burning pyres,<lb/>
and even the dead were ravished of their rest.—<lb/>
And who should mourn them wanting, all the souls<lb/>
of sons and husbands, and of old and young,<lb/>
must wander unlamented: and the land<lb/>
sufficed not for the crowded sepulchers:<lb/>
and the dense forest was denuded of all trees.<lb/>

    
“Heart-broken at the sight of this great woe,<lb/>
I wailed, ‘O Jupiter! if truth were told<lb/>
of your sweet comfort in Aegina's arms,<lb/>
if you were not ashamed of me, your son,<lb/>
restore my people, or entomb my corpse,<lb/>
that I may suffer as the ones I love.’—<lb/>
Great lightning flashed around me, and the sound<lb/>
of thunder proved that my complaint was heard.<lb/>
Accepting it, I cried, ‘Let these, Great Jove,<lb/>
the happy signs of your assent, be shown<lb/>
good omens given as a sacred pledge.’<lb/>

    
“Near by, a sacred oak tree grown from seed<lb/>
brought thither from Dodona, spread abroad<lb/>
its branches thinly covered with green leaves;<lb/>
and creeping as an army, on the tree<lb/>
we saw a train of ants that carried grain,<lb/>
half-hidden in the deep and wrinkled bark.<lb/>
And while I wondered at the endless line<lb/>
I said, ‘Good father, give me citizens<lb/>
of equal number for my empty walls.’<lb/>
Soon as I said those words, though not a wind<lb/>
was moving nor a breeze,—the lofty tree<lb/>
began to tremble, and I heard a sound<lb/>
of motion in its branches. Wonder not<lb/>
that sudden fear possessed me; and my hair<lb/>
began to rise; and I could hardly stand<lb/>
for so my weak knees tottered!—As I made<lb/>
obeisance to the soil and sacred tree,<lb/>
perhaps I cherished in my heart a thought,<lb/>
that, not acknowledged, cheered me with some hope.<lb/>


    
“At night I lay exhausted by such thoughts,<lb/>
a deep sleep seized my body, but the tree<lb/>
seemed always present—to my gaze distinct<lb/>
with all its branches—I could even see<lb/>
the birds among its leaves; and from its boughs,<lb/>
that trembled in the still air, moving ants<lb/>
were scattered to the ground in troops below;<lb/>
and ever, as they touched the soil, they grew<lb/>
larger and larger.—As they raised themselves,<lb/>
they stood with upright bodies, and put off<lb/>
their lean shapes; and absorbed their many feet:<lb/>
and even as their dark brown color changed,<lb/>
their rounded forms took on a human shape.<lb/>

    
“When my strange dream departed, I awoke,<lb/>
the vision vanished, I complained to Heaven<lb/>
against the idle comfort of such dreams;<lb/>
but as I voiced my own lament, I heard<lb/>
a mighty murmur echoing through the halls<lb/>
of my deserted palace, and a multitude<lb/>
of voices in confusion; where the sound<lb/>
of scarce an echo had disturbed the still<lb/>
deserted chambers for so many days.<lb/>

    
“All this I thought the fancy of my dream,<lb/>
until my brave son Telamon, in haste<lb/>
threw open the closed doorway, as he called,<lb/>
‘Come quickly father, and behold a sight<lb/>
beyond the utmost of your fondest dreams!’<lb/>
I did go out, and there I saw such men<lb/>
each in his turn, as I had seen transformed<lb/>
in that weird vision of the moving ants.<lb/>

    
“They all advanced, and hailed me as their king.<lb/>
So soon as I had offered vows to Jove,<lb/>
I subdivided the deserted farms,<lb/>
and dwellings in the cities to these men<lb/>
miraculously raised —which now are called<lb/>
my Myrmidons, —the living evidence<lb/>
of my strange vision. You have seen these men;<lb/>
and since that day, their name has been declared,<lb/>
‘Decisive evidence.’ They have retained<lb/>
the well-known customs of the days before<lb/>
their transformation. Patiently they toil;<lb/>
they store the profits of their labor; which<lb/>
they guard with valiant skill. They'll follow you<lb/>
to any war, well matched in years and courage,<lb/>
and I do promise, when this east wind turns,<lb/>
this wind that favored you and brought you here,<lb/>
and when a south wind favors our design,<lb/>
then my brave Myrmidons will go with you.”<lb/>


Cephalus et Procris.
CEPHALUS AND PROCRIS

This narrative and many other tales<lb/>
had occupied the day. As twilight fell,<lb/>
festivities were blended in the night—<lb/>
the night, in turn, afforded sweet repose.<lb/>
Soon as the golden Sun had shown his light,<lb/>
the east wind blowing still, the ships were stayed<lb/>
from sailing home. The sons of Pallas came<lb/>
to Cephalus, who was the elder called;<lb/>
and Cephalus together with the sons<lb/>
of Pallas, went to see the king. Deep sleep<lb/>
still held the king; and Phocus who was son<lb/>
of Aeacus, received them at the gate,<lb/>
instead of Telamon and Peleus who<lb/>
were marshalling the men for war. Into<lb/>
the inner court and beautiful apartments<lb/>
Phocus conducted the Athenians,<lb/>
and they sat down together. Phocus then<lb/>
observed that Cephalus held in his hand<lb/>
a curious javelin with golden head,<lb/>
and shaft of some rare wood. And as they talked,<lb/>
he said; “It is my pleasure to explore<lb/>
the forest in the chase of startled game,<lb/>
and so I've learned the nature of rare woods,<lb/>
but never have I seen the match of this<lb/>
from which was fashioned this good javelin;<lb/>
it lacks the yellow tint of forest ash,<lb/>
it is not knotted like all corner-wood;<lb/>
although I cannot name the kind of wood,<lb/>
my eyes have never seen a javelin-shaft<lb/>
so beautiful as this.”<lb/>

    
To him replied<lb/>
a friend of Cephalus; “But you will find<lb/>
its beauty is not equal to its worth,<lb/>
for whatsoever it is aimed against,<lb/>
its flight is always certain to the mark,<lb/>
nor is it subject to the shift of chance;<lb/>
and after it has struck, although no hand<lb/>
may cast it back, it certainly returns,<lb/>
bloodstained with every victim.”<lb/>

    
Then indeed,<lb/>
was Phocus anxious to be told, whence came<lb/>
and who had given such a precious gift.<lb/>
And Cephalus appeared to tell him all;<lb/>
but craftily was silent on one strange<lb/>
condition of the fatal gift. As he<lb/>
recalled the mournful fate of his dear wife,<lb/>
his eyes filled up with tears. “Ah, pity me,”<lb/>
he said, “If Fate should grant me many years,<lb/>
I must weep every time that I regard<lb/>
this weapon which has been my cause of tears;<lb/>
the unforgiven death of my dear wife—<lb/>
ah, would that I had never handled it!<lb/>

    
“My sweet wife, Procris!—if you could compare<lb/>
her beauty with her sister's—Orithyia's,<lb/>
(ravished by the blustering Boreas)<lb/>
you would declare my wife more beautiful.<lb/>

    
“'Tis she her sire Erectheus joined to me,<lb/>
'Tis she the god Love also joined to me.<lb/>
They called me happy, and in truth I was,<lb/>
and all pronounced us so until the Gods<lb/>
decreed it otherwise. Two joyful months<lb/>
of our united love were almost passed,<lb/>
when, as the grey light of the dawn dispelled,<lb/>
upon the summit of Hymettus green,<lb/>
Aurora, glorious in her golden robes,<lb/>
observed me busy with encircling nets,<lb/>
trapping the antlered deer.<lb/>

    
“Against my will<lb/>
incited by desire, she carried me<lb/>
away with her. Oh, let me not increase<lb/>
her anger, for I tell you what is true,<lb/>
I found no comfort in her lovely face!<lb/>
And, though she is the very queen of light,<lb/>
and reigns upon the edge of shadowy space<lb/>
where she is nourished on rich nectar-wine,<lb/>
adding delight to beauty, I could give<lb/>
no heed to her entreaties, for the thought<lb/>
of my beloved Procris intervened;<lb/>
and only her sweet name was on my lips.<lb/>

    
“I told Aurora of our wedding joys<lb/>
and all refreshing joys of love — and my<lb/>
first union of my couch deserted now:<lb/>

    
“Enraged against me, then the goddess said:<lb/>
‘Keep to your Procris, I but trouble you,<lb/>
ungrateful clown! but, if you can be warned,<lb/>
you will no longer wish for her!’ And so,<lb/>
in anger, she returned me to my wife.<lb/>

    
“Alas, as I retraced the weary way,<lb/>
long-brooding over all Aurora said,<lb/>
suspicion made me doubtful of my wife,<lb/>
so faithful and so fair.—But many things<lb/>
reminding me of steadfast virtue, I<lb/>
suppressed all doubts; until the dreadful thought<lb/>
of my long absence filled my jealous mind:<lb/>
from which I argued to the criminal<lb/>
advances of Aurora; for if she,<lb/>
so lovely in appearance, did conceal<lb/>
such passion in the garb of innocence<lb/>
until the moment of temptation, how<lb/>
could I be certain of the purity<lb/>
of even the strongest when the best are frail?<lb/>

    
“So brooding—every effort I devised<lb/>
to cause my own undoing. By the means<lb/>
of bribing presents, favored by disguise,<lb/>
I sought to win her guarded chastity.<lb/>
Aurora had disguised me, and her guile<lb/>
determined me to work in subtle snares.<lb/>

    
“Unknown to all my friends, I paced the streets<lb/>
of sacred Athens till I reached my home.<lb/>
I hoped to search out evidence of guilt:<lb/>
but everything seemed waiting my return;<lb/>
and all the household breathed an air of grief.<lb/>

    
“With difficulty I, disguised, obtained<lb/>
an entrance to her presence by the use<lb/>
of artifices many: and when I<lb/>
there saw her, silent in her grief,—amazed,<lb/>
my heart no longer prompted me to test<lb/>
such constant love. An infinite desire<lb/>
took hold upon me. I could scarce restrain<lb/>
an impulse to caress and kiss her. Pale<lb/>
with grief that I was gone, her lovely face<lb/>
in sorrow was more beautiful—the world<lb/>
has not another so divinely fair.<lb/>

    
“Ah, Phocus, it is wonderful to think<lb/>
of beauty so surpassing fair it seems<lb/>
more lovable in sorrow! Why relate<lb/>
to you how often she repulsed my feigned<lb/>
attempts upon her virtue? To each plea<lb/>
she said: ‘I serve one man: no matter where<lb/>
he may be I will keep my love for one.’<lb/>

    
“Who but a man insane with jealousy,<lb/>
would doubt the virtue of a loving wife,<lb/>
when tempted by the most insidious wiles,<lb/>
whose hallowed honor was her husband's love?<lb/>
But I, not satisfied with proof complete,<lb/>
would not abandon my depraved desire<lb/>
to poison the pure fountain I should guard;—<lb/>
increasing my temptations, I caused her<lb/>
to hesitate, and covet a rich gift.<lb/>

    
“Then, angered at my own success I said,<lb/>
discarding all disguise, ‘Behold the man<lb/>
whose lavish promise has established proof,<lb/>
the witness of your shameful treachery;<lb/>
your absent husband has returned to this!’<lb/>

    
“Unable to endure a ruined home,<lb/>
where desecration held her sin to view,<lb/>
despairing and in silent shame she fled;<lb/>
and I, the author of that wickedness<lb/>
ran after: but enraged at my deceit<lb/>
and hating all mankind, she wandered far<lb/>
in wildest mountains; hunting the wild game.<lb/>

    
“I grieved at her desertion; and the fires<lb/>
of my neglected love consumed my health;<lb/>
with greater violence my love increased,<lb/>
until unable to endure such pain,<lb/>
I begged forgiveness and acknowledged fault:<lb/>
nor hesitated to declare that I<lb/>
might yield, the same way tempted, if such great<lb/>
gifts had been offered to me. When I had made<lb/>
abject confession and she had avenged<lb/>
her outraged feelings, she came back to me<lb/>
and we spent golden years in harmony.<lb/>

    
“She gave to me the hound she fondly loved,<lb/>
the very one Diana gave to her<lb/>
when lovingly the goddess had declared,<lb/>
‘This hound all others shall excel in speed.’<lb/>
Nor was that gift the only one was given<lb/>
by kind Diana when my wife was hers,<lb/>
as you may guess—this javelin I hold forth,<lb/>
no other but a goddess could bestow.<lb/>

    
“Would you be told the story of both gifts<lb/>
attend my words and you shall be amazed,<lb/>
for never such another sad event<lb/>
has added sorrow to the grieving world.<lb/>


    
“After the son of Laius,—Oedipus,—<lb/>
had solved the riddle of the monster-sphinx,<lb/>
so often baffling to the wits of men,<lb/>
and after she had fallen from her hill,<lb/>
mangled, forgetful of her riddling craft;<lb/>
not unrevenged the mighty Themis brooked<lb/>
her loss. Without delay that goddess raised<lb/>
another savage beast to ravage Thebes,<lb/>
by which the farmer's cattle were devoured,<lb/>
the land was ruined and its people slain.<lb/>

    
“Then all the valiant young men of the realm,<lb/>
with whom I also went, enclosed the field<lb/>
(where lurked the monster) in a mesh<lb/>
of many tangled nets: but not a strand<lb/>
could stay its onrush, and it leaped the crest<lb/>
of every barrier where the toils were set.<lb/>

    
“Already they had urged their eager dogs,<lb/>
which swiftly as a bird it left behind,<lb/>
eluding all the hunters as it fled.<lb/>

    
“At last all begged me to let slip the leash<lb/>
of straining Tempest; such I called the hound,<lb/>
my dear wife's present. As he tugged and pulled<lb/>
upon the tightened cords, I let them slip:<lb/>
no sooner done, then he was lost to sight;<lb/>
although, wherever struck his rapid feet<lb/>
the hot dust whirled. Not swifter flies the spear,<lb/>
nor whizzing bullet from the twisted sling,<lb/>
nor feathered arrow from the twanging bow!<lb/>

    
“A high hill jutted from a rolling plain,<lb/>
on which I mounted to enjoy the sight<lb/>
of that unequalled chase. One moment caught,<lb/>
the next as surely free, the wild beast seemed<lb/>
now here now there, elusive in its flight;<lb/>
swiftly sped onward, or with sudden turn<lb/>
doubled in circles to deceive or gain.<lb/>
With equal speed pursuing at each turn,<lb/>
the rapid hound could neither gain nor lose.<lb/>
Now springing forward and now doubling back,<lb/>
his great speed foiled, he snapped at empty air.<lb/>

    
“I then turned to my javelin's aid; and while<lb/>
I poised it in my right hand, turned away<lb/>
my gaze a moment as I sought to twine<lb/>
my practiced fingers in the guiding thongs;<lb/>
but when again I lifted up my eyes,<lb/>
to cast the javelin where the monster sped,<lb/>
I saw two marble statues standing there,<lb/>
transformed upon the plain. One statue seemed<lb/>
to strain in attitude of rapid flight,<lb/>
the other with wide-open jaws was changed,<lb/>
just in the act of barking and pursuit.<lb/>
Surely some God—if any god controls—<lb/>
decreed both equal, neither could succeed.”<lb/>

    
Now after these miraculous events,<lb/>
it seemed he wished to stop, but Phocus said.<lb/>
“What charge have you against the javelin?”<lb/>

    
And Cephalus rejoined; “I must relate<lb/>
my sorrows last; for I would tell you first<lb/>
the story of my joys—'Tis sweet to think,<lb/>
upon the gliding tide of those few years<lb/>
of married life, when my dear wife and I<lb/>
were happy in our love and confidence.<lb/>
No woman could allure me then from her;<lb/>
and even Venus could not tempt my love;<lb/>
all my great passion for my dearest wife<lb/>
was equalled by the passion she returned.<lb/>

    
“As early as the sun, when golden rays<lb/>
first glittered on the mountains, I would rise<lb/>
in youthful ardor, to explore the fields<lb/>
in search of game. With no companions, hounds,<lb/>
nor steeds nor nets, this javelin was alone<lb/>
my safety and companion in my sport.<lb/>

    
“And often when my right hand felt its weight,<lb/>
a-wearied of the slaughter it had caused,<lb/>
I would come back to rest in the cool shade,<lb/>
and breezes from cool vales—the breeze I wooed,<lb/>
blowing so gently on me in the heat;<lb/>
the breeze I waited for; she was my rest<lb/>
from labor. I remember, ‘Aura come,’<lb/>
I used to say, ‘Come soothe me, come into<lb/>
my breast most welcome one, and yes indeed,<lb/>
you do relieve the heat with which I burn.’<lb/>

    
“And as I felt the sweet breeze of the morn,<lb/>
as if in answer to my song, my fate impelled<lb/>
me further to declare my joy in song;<lb/>

    
“ ‘You are my comfort, you are my delight!<lb/>
Refresh me, cherish me, breathe on my face!<lb/>
I love you child of lonely haunts and trees!’<lb/>

    
“Such words I once was singing, not aware<lb/>
of some one spying on me from the trees,<lb/>
who thought I sang to some beloved Nymph,<lb/>
or goddess by the name of Aura—so<lb/>
I always called the breeze.—Unhappy man!<lb/>
The meddling tell-tale went to Procris with<lb/>
a story of supposed unfaithfulness,<lb/>
and slyly told in whispers all he heard.<lb/>
True love is credulous; (and as I heard<lb/>
the story) Procris in a swoon fell down.<lb/>
When she awakened from her bitter swoon,<lb/>
she ceased not wailing her unhappy fate,<lb/>
and, wretched, moaned for an imagined woe.<lb/>

    
“So she lamented what was never done!<lb/>
Her woe incited by a whispered tale,<lb/>
she feared the fiction of a harmless name!<lb/>
But hope returning soothed her wretched state;<lb/>
and now, no longer willing to believe<lb/>
such wrong, unless her own eyes saw it, she<lb/>
refused to think her husband sinned.<lb/>

    
“When dawn<lb/>
had banished night, and I, rejoicing, ranged<lb/>
the breathing woods, victorious in the hunt<lb/>
paused and said, ‘Come Aura—lovely breeze—<lb/>
relieve my panting breast!’ It seemed I heard<lb/>
the smothered moans of sorrow as I spoke:<lb/>
but not conceiving harm, I said again;<lb/>

    
“ ‘Come here, oh my delight!’ And as those words<lb/>
fell from my lips, I thought I heard a soft<lb/>
sound in the thicket, as of moving leaves;<lb/>
and thinking surely 'twas a hidden beast,<lb/>
I threw this winged javelin at the spot.—<lb/>

    
“It was my own wife, Procris, and the shaft<lb/>
was buried in her breast—‘Ah, wretched me!’<lb/>
She cried; and when I heard her well-known voice,<lb/>
distracted I ran towards her,—only to find<lb/>
her bathed in blood, and dying from the wound<lb/>
of that same javelin she had given to me:<lb/>
and in her agony she drew it forth,—<lb/>
ah me! alas! from her dear tender side.<lb/>

    
“I lifted her limp body to my own,<lb/>
in these blood-guilty arms, and wrapped the wound<lb/>
with fragments of my tunic, that I tore<lb/>
in haste to staunch her blood; and all the while<lb/>
I moaned, ‘Oh, do not now forsake me—slain<lb/>
by these accursed hands!’<lb/>

    
“Weak with the loss<lb/>
of blood, and dying, she compelled herself<lb/>
to utter these few words, ‘It is my death;<lb/>
but let my eyes not close upon this life<lb/>
before I plead with you! — By the dear ties<lb/>
of sacred marriage; by your god and mine;<lb/>
and if my love for you can move your heart;<lb/>
and even by the cause of my sad death,—<lb/>
my love for you increasing as I die,—<lb/>
ah, put away that Aura you have called,<lb/>
that she may never separate your soul,—<lb/>
your love from me.’<lb/>

    
“So, by those dying words<lb/>
I knew that she had heard me call the name<lb/>
of Aura, when I wished the cooling breeze,<lb/>
and thought I called a goddess,—cause of all<lb/>
her jealous sorrow and my bitter woe<lb/>

    
“Alas, too late, I told her the sad truth;<lb/>
but she was sinking, and her little strength<lb/>
swiftly was ebbing with her flowing blood.<lb/>
As long as life remained her loving gaze<lb/>
was fixed on mine; and her unhappy life<lb/>
at last was breathed out on my grieving face.<lb/>
It seemed to me a look of sweet content<lb/>
was in her face, as if she feared not death.”<lb/>

    
In tears he folds these things; and, as they wept<lb/>
in came the aged monarch, Aeacus,<lb/>
and with the monarch his two valiant sons,<lb/>
and troops, new-levied, trained to glorious arms.<lb/>

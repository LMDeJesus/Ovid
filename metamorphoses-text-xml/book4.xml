Minyeides.
THE DAUGHTERS OF KING MINYAS TRANSFORMED TO BATS

Alcithoe, daughter of King Minyas,<lb/>
consents not to the orgies of the God;<lb/>
denies that Bacchus is the son of Jove,<lb/>
and her two sisters join her in that crime.<lb/>

    
'Twas festal-day when matrons and their maids,<lb/>
keeping it sacred, had forbade all toil.—<lb/>
And having draped their bosoms with wild skins,<lb/>
they loosed their long hair for the sacred wreaths,<lb/>
and took the leafy thyrsus in their hands;—<lb/>
for so the priest commanded them. Austere<lb/>
the wrath of Bacchus if his power be scorned.<lb/>

    
Mothers and youthful brides obeyed the priest;<lb/>
and putting by their wickers and their webs,<lb/>
dropt their unfinished toils to offer up<lb/>
frankincense to the God; invoking him<lb/>
with many names:—“O Bacchus! O Twice-born!<lb/>
O Fire-begot! Thou only child Twice-mothered!<lb/>
God of all those who plant the luscious grape!<lb/>
O Liber!” All these names and many more,<lb/>
for ages known—throughout the lands of Greece.<lb/>

    
“Thy youth is not consumed by wasting time;<lb/>
and lo, thou art an ever-youthful boy,<lb/>
most beautiful of all the Gods of Heaven,<lb/>
smooth as a virgin when thy horns are hid.—<lb/>
The distant east to tawny India's clime,<lb/>
where rolls remotest Ganges to the sea,<lb/>
was conquered by thy might.—O Most-revered!<lb/>
Thou didst destroy the doubting Pentheus,<lb/>
and hurled the sailors' bodies in the deep,<lb/>
and smote Lycurgus, wielder of the ax.<lb/>

    
“And thou dost guide thy lynxes, double-yoked,<lb/>
with showy harness.—Satyrs follow thee;<lb/>
and Bacchanals, and old Silenus, drunk,<lb/>
unsteady on his staff; jolting so rough<lb/>
on his small back-bent ass; and all the way<lb/>
resounds a youthful clamour; and the screams<lb/>
of women! and the noise of tambourines!<lb/>
And the hollow cymbals! and the boxwood flutes,—<lb/>
fitted with measured holes.—Thou art implored<lb/>
by all Ismenian women to appear<lb/>
peaceful and mild; and they perform thy rites.”<lb/>

    
Only the daughters of King Minyas<lb/>
are carding wool within their fastened doors,<lb/>
or twisting with their thumbs the fleecy yarn,<lb/>
or working at the web. So they corrupt<lb/>
the sacred festival with needless toil,<lb/>
keeping their hand-maids busy at the work.<lb/>

    
And one of them, while drawing out the thread<lb/>
with nimble thumb, anon began to speak;<lb/>
“While others loiter and frequent these rites<lb/>
fantastic, we the wards of Pallas, much<lb/>
to be preferred, by speaking novel thoughts<lb/>
may lighten labour. Let us each in turn,<lb/>
relate to an attentive audience,<lb/>
a novel tale; and so the hours may glide.”<lb/>
it pleased her sisters, and they ordered her<lb/>
to tell the story that she loved the most.<lb/>

    
So, as she counted in her well-stored mind<lb/>
the many tales she knew, first doubted she<lb/>
whether to tell the tale of Derceto,—<lb/>
that Babylonian, who, aver the tribes<lb/>
of Palestine, in limpid ponds yet lives,—<lb/>
her body changed, and scales upon her limbs;<lb/>
or how her daughter, having taken wings,<lb/>
passed her declining years in whitened towers.<lb/>
Or should she tell of Nais, who with herbs,<lb/>
too potent, into fishes had transformed<lb/>
the bodies of her lovers, till she met<lb/>
herself the same sad fate; or of that tree<lb/>
which sometime bore white fruit, but now is changed<lb/>
and darkened by the blood that stained its roots.—<lb/>
Pleased with the novelty of this, at once<lb/>
she tells the tale of Pyramus and Thisbe;—<lb/>
and swiftly as she told it unto them,<lb/>
the fleecy wool was twisted into threads.<lb/>


Pyramus et Thisbe.
PYRAMUS AND THISBE

When Pyramus and Thisbe, who were known<lb/>
the one most handsome of all youthful men,<lb/>
the other loveliest of all eastern girls,—<lb/>
lived in adjoining houses, near the walls<lb/>
that Queen Semiramis had built of brick<lb/>
around her famous city, they grew fond,<lb/>
and loved each other—meeting often there—<lb/>
and as the days went by their love increased.<lb/>

    
They wished to join in marriage, but that joy<lb/>
their fathers had forbidden them to hope;<lb/>
and yet the passion that with equal strength<lb/>
inflamed their minds no parents could forbid.<lb/>
No relatives had guessed their secret love,<lb/>
for all their converse was by nods and signs;<lb/>
and as a smoldering fire may gather heat,<lb/>
the more 'tis smothered, so their love increased.<lb/>

    
Now, it so happened, a partition built<lb/>
between their houses, many years ago,<lb/>
was made defective with a little chink;<lb/>
a small defect observed by none, although<lb/>
for ages there; but what is hid from love?<lb/>
Our lovers found the secret opening,<lb/>
and used its passage to convey the sounds<lb/>
of gentle, murmured words, whose tuneful note<lb/>
passed oft in safety through that hidden way.<lb/>

    
There, many a time, they stood on either side,<lb/>
thisbe on one and Pyramus the other,<lb/>
and when their warm breath touched from lip to lip,<lb/>
their sighs were such as this: “Thou envious wall<lb/>
why art thou standing in the way of those<lb/>
who die for love? What harm could happen thee<lb/>
shouldst thou permit us to enjoy our love?<lb/>
But if we ask too much, let us persuade<lb/>
that thou wilt open while we kiss but once:<lb/>
for, we are not ungrateful; unto thee<lb/>
we own our debt; here thou hast left a way<lb/>
that breathed words may enter loving ears.,”<lb/>
so vainly whispered they, and when the night<lb/>
began to darken they exchanged farewells;<lb/>
made presence that they kissed a fond farewell<lb/>
vain kisses that to love might none avail.<lb/>

    
When dawn removed the glimmering lamps of night,<lb/>
and the bright sun had dried the dewy grass<lb/>
again they met where they had told their love;<lb/>
and now complaining of their hapless fate,<lb/>
in murmurs gentle, they at last resolved,<lb/>
away to slip upon the quiet night,<lb/>
elude their parents, and, as soon as free,<lb/>
quit the great builded city and their homes.<lb/>

    
Fearful to wander in the pathless fields,<lb/>
they chose a trysting place, the tomb of Ninus,<lb/>
where safely they might hide unseen, beneath<lb/>
the shadow of a tall mulberry tree,<lb/>
covered with snow-white fruit, close by a spring.<lb/>

    
All is arranged according to their hopes:<lb/>
and now the daylight, seeming slowly moved,<lb/>
sinks in the deep waves, and the tardy night<lb/>
arises from the spot where day declines.<lb/>

    
Quickly, the clever Thisbe having first<lb/>
deceived her parents, opened the closed door.<lb/>
She flitted in the silent night away;<lb/>
and, having veiled her face, reached the great tomb,<lb/>
and sat beneath the tree; love made her bold.<lb/>

    
There, as she waited, a great lioness<lb/>
approached the nearby spring to quench her thirst:<lb/>
her frothing jaws incarnadined with blood<lb/>
of slaughtered oxen. As the moon was bright,<lb/>
Thisbe could see her, and affrighted fled<lb/>
with trembling footstep to a gloomy cave;<lb/>
and as she ran she slipped and dropped her veil,<lb/>
which fluttered to the ground. She did not dare<lb/>
to save it. Wherefore, when the savage beast<lb/>
had taken a great draft and slaked her thirst,<lb/>
and thence had turned to seek her forest lair,<lb/>
she found it on her way, and full of rage,<lb/>
tore it and stained it with her bloody jaws:<lb/>
but Thisbe, fortunate, escaped unseen.<lb/>

    
Now Pyramus had not gone out so soon<lb/>
as Thisbe to the tryst; and, when he saw<lb/>
the certain traces of that savage beast,<lb/>
imprinted in the yielding dust, his face<lb/>
went white with fear; but when he found the veil<lb/>
covered with blood, he cried; “Alas, one night<lb/>
has caused the ruin of two lovers! Thou<lb/>
wert most deserving of completed days,<lb/>
but as for me, my heart is guilty! I<lb/>
destroyed thee! O my love! I bade thee come<lb/>
out in the dark night to a lonely haunt,<lb/>
and failed to go before. Oh! whatever lurks<lb/>
beneath this rock, though ravenous lion, tear<lb/>
my guilty flesh, and with most cruel jaws<lb/>
devour my cursed entrails! What? Not so;<lb/>
it is a craven's part to wish for death!”<lb/>

    
So he stopped briefly; and took up the veil;<lb/>
went straightway to the shadow of the tree;<lb/>
and as his tears bedewed the well-known veil,<lb/>
he kissed it oft and sighing said, “Kisses<lb/>
and tears are thine, receive my blood as well.”<lb/>

    
And he imbrued the steel, girt at his side,<lb/>
deep in his bowels; and plucked it from the wound,<lb/>
a-faint with death. As he fell back to earth,<lb/>
his spurting blood shot upward in the air;<lb/>
so, when decay has rift a leaden pipe<lb/>
a hissing jet of water spurts on high.—<lb/>

    
By that dark tide the berries on the tree<lb/>
assumed a deeper tint, for as the roots<lb/>
soaked up the blood the pendent mulberries<lb/>
were dyed a purple tint.<lb/>

    
Thisbe returned,<lb/>
though trembling still with fright, for now she thought<lb/>
her lover must await her at the tree,<lb/>
and she should haste before he feared for her.<lb/>
Longing to tell him of her great escape<lb/>
she sadly looked for him with faithful eyes;<lb/>
but when she saw the spot and the changed tree,<lb/>
she doubted could they be the same, for so<lb/>
the colour of the hanging fruit deceived.<lb/>

    
While doubt dismayed her, on the ground she saw<lb/>
the wounded body covered with its blood;—<lb/>
she started backward, and her face grew pale<lb/>
and ashen; and she shuddered like the sea,<lb/>
which trembles when its face is lightly skimmed<lb/>
by the chill breezes;—and she paused a space;—<lb/>
but when she knew it was the one she loved,<lb/>
she struck her tender breast and tore her hair.<lb/>
Then wreathing in her arms his loved form,<lb/>
she bathed the wound with tears, mingling her grief<lb/>
in his unquenched blood; and as she kissed<lb/>
his death-cold features wailed; “Ah Pyramus,<lb/>
what cruel fate has taken thy life away?<lb/>
Pyramus! Pyramus! awake! awake!<lb/>
It is thy dearest Thisbe calls thee! Lift<lb/>
thy drooping head! Alas,”—At Thisbe's name<lb/>
he raised his eyes, though languorous in death,<lb/>
and darkness gathered round him as he gazed.<lb/>

    
And then she saw her veil; and near it lay<lb/>
his ivory sheath—but not the trusty sword <lb/>
and once again she wailed; “Thy own right hand,<lb/>
and thy great passion have destroyed thee!—<lb/>
And I? my hand shall be as bold as thine—<lb/>
my love shall nerve me to the fatal deed—<lb/>
thee, I will follow to eternity—<lb/>
though I be censured for the wretched cause,<lb/>
so surely I shall share thy wretched fate:—<lb/>
alas, whom death could me alone bereave,<lb/>
thou shalt not from my love be reft by death!<lb/>
And, O ye wretched parents, mine and his,<lb/>
let our misfortunes and our pleadings melt<lb/>
your hearts, that ye no more deny to those<lb/>
whom constant love and lasting death unite—<lb/>
entomb us in a single sepulchre.<lb/>

    
“And, O thou tree of many-branching boughs,<lb/>
spreading dark shadows on the corpse of one,<lb/>
destined to cover twain, take thou our fate<lb/>
upon thy head; mourn our untimely deaths;<lb/>
let thy fruit darken for a memory,<lb/>
an emblem of our blood.” No more she said;<lb/>
and having fixed the point below her breast,<lb/>
she fell on the keen sword, still warm with his red blood.<lb/>

    
But though her death was out of Nature's law<lb/>
her prayer was answered, for it moved the Gods<lb/>
and moved their parents. Now the Gods have changed<lb/>
the ripened fruit which darkens on the branch:<lb/>
and from the funeral pile their parents sealed<lb/>
their gathered ashes in a single urn.<lb/>


Venus et Mars. Leucothoe. Clytie.
MARS AND VENUS

So ended she; at once Leuconoe<lb/>
took the narrator's thread; and as she spoke<lb/>
her sisters all were silent.<lb/>

    
“Even the Sun<lb/>
that rules the world was captive made of Love.<lb/>
My theme shall be a love-song of the Sun.<lb/>
'Tis said the Lord of Day, whose wakeful eye<lb/>
beholds at once whatever may transpire,<lb/>
witnessed the loves of Mars and Venus. Grieved<lb/>
to know the wrong, he called the son of Juno,<lb/>
Vulcan, and gave full knowledge of the deed,<lb/>
showing how Mars and Venus shamed his love,<lb/>
as they defiled his bed. Vulcan amazed,—<lb/>
the nimble-thoughted Vulcan lost his wits,<lb/>
so that he dropped the work his right hand held.<lb/>

    
But turning from all else at once he set<lb/>
to file out chains of brass, delicate, fine,<lb/>
from which to fashion nets invisible,<lb/>
filmy of mesh and airy as the thread<lb/>
of insect-web, that from the rafter swings.—<lb/>

    
Implicit woven that they yielded soft<lb/>
the slightest movement or the gentlest touch,<lb/>
with cunning skill he drew them round the bed<lb/>
where they were sure to dally. Presently<lb/>
appeared the faithless wife, and on the couch<lb/>
lay down to languish with her paramour.—<lb/>
Meshed in the chains they could not thence arise,<lb/>
nor could they else but lie in strict embrace,—<lb/>
cunningly thus entrapped by Vulcan's wit.—<lb/>

    
At once the Lemnian cuckold opened wide<lb/>
the folding ivory doors and called the Gods,—<lb/>
to witness. There they lay disgraced and bound.<lb/>
I wot were many of the lighter Gods<lb/>
who wished themselves in like disgraceful bonds.—<lb/>
The Gods were moved to laughter: and the tale<lb/>
was long most noted in the courts of Heaven.<lb/>

    
The Cytherean Venus brooded on<lb/>
the Sun's betrayal of her stolen joys,<lb/>
and thought to torture him in passion's pains,<lb/>
and wreak requital for the pain he caused.<lb/>

LEUCOTHEA AND CLYTIE

Son of Hyperion! what avails thy light?<lb/>
What is the profit of thy glowing heat?<lb/>
Lo, thou whose flames have parched innumerous lands,<lb/>
thyself art burning with another flame!<lb/>
And thou whose orb should joy the universe<lb/>
art gazing only on Leucothea's charms.<lb/>

    
Thy glorious eye on one fair maid is fixed,<lb/>
forgetting all besides. Too early thou<lb/>
art rising from thy bed of orient skies,<lb/>
too late thy setting in the western waves;<lb/>
so taking time to gaze upon thy love,<lb/>
thy frenzy lengthens out the wintry hour!<lb/>

    
And often thou art darkened in eclipse,<lb/>
dark shadows of this trouble in thy mind,<lb/>
unwonted aspect, casting man perplexed<lb/>
in abject terror. Pale thou art, though not<lb/>
betwixt thee and the earth the shadowous moon<lb/>
bedims thy devious way. Thy passion gives<lb/>
to grief thy countenance—for her thy heart<lb/>
alone is grieving—Clymene and Rhodos,<lb/>
and Persa, mother of deluding Circe,<lb/>
are all forgotten for thy doting hope;<lb/>
even Clytie, who is yearning for thy love,<lb/>
no more can charm thee; thou art so foredone.<lb/>

    
Leucothea is the cause of many tears,<lb/>
Leucothea, daughter of Eurynome,<lb/>
most beauteous matron of Arabia's strand,<lb/>
where spicey odours blow. Eurynome<lb/>
in youthful prime excelled her mother's grace,<lb/>
and, save her daughter, all excelled besides.<lb/>
Leucothea's father, Orchamas was king<lb/>
where Achaemenes whilom held the sway;<lb/>
and Orchamas from ancient Belus' death<lb/>
might count his reign the seventh in descent.<lb/>

    
The dark-night pastures of Apollo's steeds<lb/>
are hid below the western skies; when there,<lb/>
and spent with toil, in lieu of nibbling herbs<lb/>
they take ambrosial food: it gives their limbs<lb/>
restoring strength and nourishes anew.<lb/>

    
Now while these coursers eat celestial food<lb/>
and Night resumes his reign, the god appears<lb/>
disguised, unguessed, as old Eurynome<lb/>
to fair Leucothea as she draws the threads,<lb/>
all smoothly twisted from her spindle. There<lb/>
she sits with twice six hand-maids ranged around,<lb/>
and as the god beholds her at the door<lb/>
he kisses her, as if a child beloved<lb/>
and he her mother. And he spoke to her:<lb/>

“Let thy twelve hand-maids leave us undisturbed,<lb/>
for I have things of close import to tell,<lb/>
and seemly, from a mother to her child.”,<lb/>
so when they all withdrew the god began,<lb/>
“Lo, I am he who measures the long year;<lb/>
I see all things, and through me the wide world<lb/>
may see all things; I am the glowing eye<lb/>
of the broad universe! Thou art to me<lb/>
the glory of the earth!” Filled with alarm,<lb/>
from her relaxed fingers she let fall<lb/>
the distaff and the spindle, but, her fear<lb/>
so lovely in her beauty seemed, the God<lb/>
no longer brooked delay: he changed his form<lb/>
back to his wonted beauty and resumed<lb/>
his bright celestial. Startled at the sight<lb/>
the maid recoiled a space; but presently<lb/>
the glory of the god inspired her love;<lb/>
and all her timid doubts dissolved away;<lb/>
without complaint she melted in his arms.<lb/>

    
So ardently the bright Apollo loved,<lb/>
that Clytie, envious of Leucothea's joy,<lb/>
where evil none was known, a scandal made;<lb/>
and having published wide their secret love,<lb/>
leucothea's father also heard the tale.<lb/>
Relentlessly and fierce, his cruel hand<lb/>
buried his living daughter in the ground,<lb/>
who, while her arms implored the glowing Sun,<lb/>
complained. “For love of thee my life is lost.”<lb/>
And as she wailed her father sowed her there.<lb/>

    
Hyperion's Son began with piercing heat<lb/>
to scatter the loose sand, a way to open,<lb/>
that she might look with beauteous features forth<lb/>
too late! for smothered by the compact earth,<lb/>
thou canst not lift thy drooping head; alas!<lb/>
A lifeless corse remains.<lb/>

    
No sadder sight<lb/>
since Phaethon was blasted by the bolt,<lb/>
down-hurled by Jove, had ever grieved the God<lb/>
who daily drives his winged steeds. In vain<lb/>
he strives with all the magic of his rays<lb/>
to warm her limbs anew. — The deed is done—<lb/>
what vantage gives his might if fate deny?<lb/>
He sprinkles fragrant nectar on her grave,<lb/>
and lifeless corse, and as he wails exclaims,<lb/>
“But naught shall hinder you to reach the skies.”<lb/>

    
At once the maiden's body, steeped in dews<lb/>
of nectar, sweet and odourate, dissolves<lb/>
and adds its fragrant juices to the earth:<lb/>
slowly from this a sprout of Frankincense<lb/>
takes root in riched soil, and bursting through<lb/>
the sandy hillock shows its top.<lb/>

    
No more<lb/>
to Clytie comes the author of sweet light,<lb/>
for though her love might make excuse of grief,<lb/>
and grief may plead to pardon jealous words,<lb/>
his heart disdains the schemist of his woe;<lb/>
and she who turned to sour the sweet of love,<lb/>
from that unhallowed moment pined away.<lb/>
Envious and hating all her sister Nymphs,<lb/>
day after day,—and through the lonely nights,<lb/>
all unprotected from the chilly breeze,<lb/>
her hair dishevelled, tangled, unadorned,<lb/>
she sat unmoved upon the bare hard ground.<lb/>

    
Nine days the Nymph was nourished by the dews,<lb/>
or haply by her own tears' bitter brine;—<lb/>
all other nourishment was naught to her.—<lb/>
She never raised herself from the bare ground,<lb/>
though on the god her gaze was ever fixed;—<lb/>
she turned her features towards him as he moved:<lb/>
they say that afterwhile her limbs took root<lb/>
and fastened to the around.<lb/>

    
A pearly white<lb/>
overspread her countenance, that turned as pale<lb/>
and bloodless as the dead; but here and there<lb/>
a blushing tinge resolved in violet tint;<lb/>
and something like the blossom of that name<lb/>
a flower concealed her face. Although a root<lb/>
now holds her fast to earth, the Heliotrope<lb/>
turns ever to the Sun, as if to prove<lb/>
that all may change and love through all remain.<lb/>


Salmacis.

Thus was the story ended. All were charmed<lb/>
to hear recounted such mysterious deeds.<lb/>
While some were doubting whether such were true<lb/>
others affirmed that to the living Gods<lb/>
is nothing to restrain their wondrous works,<lb/>
though surely of the Gods, immortal, none<lb/>
accorded Bacchus even thought or place.<lb/>

    
When all had made an end of argument,<lb/>
they bade Alcithoe take up the word:<lb/>
she, busily working on the pendent web,<lb/>
still shot the shuttle through the warp and said;<lb/>
“The amours of the shepherd Daphnis, known<lb/>
to many of you, I shall not relate;<lb/>
the shepherd Daphnis of Mount Ida, who<lb/>
was turned to stone obdurate, for the Nymph<lb/>
whose love he slighted—so the rivalry<lb/>
of love neglected rouses to revenge:<lb/>
neither shall I relate the story told<lb/>
of Scython, double-sexed, who first was man,<lb/>
then altered to a woman: so I pass<lb/>
the tale of Celmus turned to adamant,<lb/>
who reared almighty Jove from tender youth:<lb/>
so, likewise the Curetes whom the rain<lb/>
brought forth to life: Smilax and Crocus, too,<lb/>
transpeciated into little flowers:<lb/>
all these I pass to tell a novel tale,<lb/>
which haply may resolve in pleasant thoughts.<lb/>

HERMAPHRODITUS

Learn how the fountain, Salmacis, became<lb/>
so infamous; learn how it enervates<lb/>
and softens the limbs of those who chance to bathe.<lb/>
Although the fountain's properties are known,<lb/>
the cause is yet unknown. The Naiads nursed<lb/>
an infant son of Hermes, surely his<lb/>
of Aphrodite gotten in the caves<lb/>
of Ida, for the child resembled both<lb/>
the god and goddess, and his name was theirs.<lb/>

    
The years passed by, and when the boy had reached<lb/>
the limit of three lustrums, he forsook<lb/>
his native mountains; for he loved to roam<lb/>
through unimagined places, by the banks<lb/>
of undiscovered rivers; and the joy<lb/>
of finding wonders made his labour light.<lb/>

    
Leaving Mount Ida, where his youth was spent,<lb/>
he reached the land of Lycia, and from thence<lb/>
the verge of Caria, where a pretty pool<lb/>
of soft translucent water may be seen,<lb/>
so clear the glistening bottom glads the eye:<lb/>
no barren sedge, no fenny reeds annoy,<lb/>
no rushes with their sharpened arrow-points,<lb/>
but all around the edges of that pool<lb/>
the softest grass engirdles with its green.<lb/>

    
A Nymph dwells there, unsuited to the chase,<lb/>
unskilled to bend the bow, slothful of foot,<lb/>
the only Naiad in the world unknown<lb/>
to rapid-running Dian. Whensoever<lb/>
her Naiad sisters pled in winged words,<lb/>
“Take up the javelin, sister Salmacis,<lb/>
take up the painted quiver and unite<lb/>
your leisure with the action of the chase;”<lb/>
she only scorned the javelin and the quiver,<lb/>
nor joined her leisure to the active chase.<lb/>

    
Rather she bathes her smooth and shapely limbs;<lb/>
or combs her tresses with a boxwood comb,<lb/>
Citorian; or looking in the pool<lb/>
consults the glassed waters of effects<lb/>
increasing beauty; or she decks herself<lb/>
in gauzy raiment, and reposing lolls<lb/>
on cushioned leaves, or grass-enverdured beds;<lb/>
or gathers posies from the spangled lawns.<lb/>
Now, haply as she culled the sweetest flowers<lb/>
she saw the youth, and longing in her heart<lb/>
made havoc as her greedy eyes beheld.<lb/>

    
Although her love could scarcely brook delay,<lb/>
she waited to enhance her loveliness,<lb/>
in beauty hoping to allure his love.<lb/>
All richly dight she scanned herself and robes,<lb/>
to know that every charm should fair appear,<lb/>
and she be worthy: wherefore she began:<lb/>

“O godlike youth! if thou art of the skies,<lb/>
thou art no other than the god of Love;<lb/>
if mortal, blest are they who gave thee birth;<lb/>
happy thy brother; happy, fortunate<lb/>
thy sister; happy, fortunate and blest<lb/>
the nurse that gave her bosom; but the joys<lb/>
surpassing all, dearest and tenderest,<lb/>
are hers whom thou shalt wed. So, let it be<lb/>
if thou so young have deigned to marry, let<lb/>
my joys be stolen; if unmarried, join<lb/>
with me in wedlock.” So she spoke, and stood<lb/>
in silence waiting for the youth's reply.<lb/>

    
He knows nor cares for love—with loveliness<lb/>
the mounting blushes tinge his youthful cheeks,<lb/>
as blush-red tint of apples on the tree,<lb/>
ripe in the summer sun, or as the hue<lb/>
of painted ivory, or the round moon<lb/>
red-blushing in her splendour, when the clash<lb/>
of brass resounds in vain. And long the Nymph<lb/>
implored; almost clung on his neck, as smooth<lb/>
and white as ivory; unceasingly<lb/>
imploring him to kiss her, though as chaste<lb/>
as kisses to a sister; but the youth<lb/>
outwearied, thus:<lb/>

“I do beseech you make<lb/>
an end of this; or must I fly the place<lb/>
and leave you to your tears?” Affrighted then<lb/>
said Salmacis, “To you I freely give—<lb/>
good stranger here remain.” Although she made<lb/>
fair presence to retire, she hid herself,<lb/>
that from a shrub-grown covert, on her knees<lb/>
she might observe unseen.<lb/>

    
As any boy<lb/>
that heedless deems his mischief unobserved,<lb/>
now here now there, he rambled on the green;<lb/>
now in the bubbly ripples dipped his feet,<lb/>
now dallied in the clear pool ankle-deep;—<lb/>
the warm-cool feeling of the liquid then,<lb/>
so pleased him, that without delay he doffed<lb/>
his fleecy garments from his tender limbs.<lb/>

    
Ah, Salmacis, amazement is thy meed!<lb/>
Thou art consumed to know his naked grace!<lb/>
As the hot glitters of the round bright sun<lb/>
collected, sparkle from the polished plate,<lb/>
thine eyes are glistened with delirious fires.<lb/>

    
Delay she cannot; panting for his joy,<lb/>
languid for his caressing, crazed, distract,<lb/>
her passion difficult is held in check.—<lb/>

    
He claps his body with his hollow palms<lb/>
and lightly vaults into the limped wave,<lb/>
and darting through the water hand over hand<lb/>
shines in the liquid element, as though<lb/>
should one enhance a statue's ivorine,<lb/>
or glaze the lily in a lake of glass.<lb/>

    
And thus the Naiad, “I have gained my suit;<lb/>
his love is mine,—is mine!” Quickly disrobed,<lb/>
she plunged into the yielding wave—seized him,<lb/>
caressed him, clung to him a thousand ways,<lb/>
kissed him, thrust down her hands and touched his breast:<lb/>
reluctant and resisting he endeavours<lb/>
to make escape, but even as he struggles<lb/>
she winds herself about him, as entwines<lb/>
the serpent which the royal bird on high<lb/>
holds in his talons; —as it hangs, it coils<lb/>
in sinuous folds around the eagle's feet;—<lb/>
twisting its coils around his head and wings:<lb/>
or as the ivy clings to sturdy oaks;<lb/>
or as the polypus beneath the waves,<lb/>
by pulling down, with suckers on all sides,<lb/>
tenacious holds its prey. And yet the youth,<lb/>
descendant of great Atlas, not relents<lb/>
nor gives the Naiad joy. Pressing her suit<lb/>
she winds her limbs around him and exclaims,<lb/>
“You shall not scape me, struggle as you will,<lb/>
perverse and obstinate! Hear me, ye Gods!<lb/>
Let never time release the youth from me;<lb/>
time never let me from the youth release!”<lb/>


    
Propitious deities accord her prayers:<lb/>
the mingled bodies of the pair unite<lb/>
and fashion in a single human form.<lb/>
So one might see two branches underneath<lb/>
a single rind uniting grow as one:<lb/>
so, these two bodies in a firm embrace<lb/>
no more are twain, but with a two-fold form<lb/>
nor man nor woman may be called—Though both<lb/>
in seeming they are neither one of twain.<lb/>

    
When that Hermaphroditus felt the change,<lb/>
so wrought upon him by the languid fount,<lb/>
considered that he entered it a man,<lb/>
and now his limbs relaxing in the stream<lb/>
he is not wholly male, but only half,—<lb/>
he lifted up his hands and thus implored,<lb/>
albeit with no manly voice; “Hear me<lb/>
O father! hear me mother! grant to me<lb/>
this boon; to me whose name is yours, your son;<lb/>
whoso shall enter in this fount a man<lb/>
must leave its waters only half a man.”<lb/>
Moved by the words of their bi-natured son<lb/>
both parents yield assent: they taint the fount<lb/>
with essences of dual-working powers.<lb/>

    
Now though the daughters of King Minyas<lb/>
have made an end of telling tales, they make<lb/>
no end of labour; for they so despise<lb/>
the deity, and desecrate his feast.<lb/>

    
While busily engaged, with sudden beat<lb/>
they hear resounding tambourines; and pipes<lb/>
and crooked horns and tinkling brass renew,<lb/>
unseen, the note; saffron and myrrh dissolve<lb/>
in dulcet odours; and, beyond belief,<lb/>
the woven webs, dependent on the loom,<lb/>
take tints of green, put forth new ivy leaves,<lb/>
or change to grape-vines verdant. There the thread<lb/>
is twisted into tendrils, there the warp<lb/>
is fashioned into many-moving leaves—<lb/>
the purple lends its splendour to the grape.<lb/>

    
And now the day is past; it is the hour<lb/>
when night ambiguous merges into day,<lb/>
which dubious owns nor light nor dun obscure;<lb/>
and suddenly the house begins to shake,<lb/>
and torches oil-dipped seem to flare around,<lb/>
and fires a-glow to shine in every room,<lb/>
and phantoms, feigned of savage beasts, to howl.—<lb/>

    
Full of affright amid the smoking halls<lb/>
the sisters vainly hide, and wheresoever<lb/>
they deem security from flaming fires,<lb/>
fearfully flit. And while they seek to hide,<lb/>
a membrane stretches over every limb,<lb/>
and light wings open from their slender arms.<lb/>

    
In the weird darkness they are unaware<lb/>
what measure wrought to change their wonted shape.<lb/>
No plumous vans avail to lift their flight,<lb/>
yet fair they balance on membraneous wing.<lb/>
Whenever they would speak a tiny voice,<lb/>
diminutive, apportioned to their size,<lb/>
in squeaking note complains. Adread the light,<lb/>
their haunts avoid by day the leafy woods,<lb/>
for sombre attics, where secure they rest<lb/>
till forth the dun obscure their wings may stretch<lb/>
at hour of Vesper;—this accords their name.<lb/>


Athamas et Ino.
ATHAMAS AND INO

Throughout the land of Thebes miraculous<lb/>
the power of Bacchus waxed; and far and wide<lb/>
Ino, his aunt, reported the great deeds<lb/>
by this divinity performed. Of all<lb/>
her sisters only she escaped unharmed,<lb/>
when Fate destroyed them, and she knew not grief—<lb/>
only for sorrow of her sisters' woes.—<lb/>

    
While Ino vaunted of her mother-joys,<lb/>
and of her kingly husband, Athamas,<lb/>
and of the mighty God, her foster-child;<lb/>
Juno, disdaining her in secret, said;<lb/>
“How shall the offspring of a concubine<lb/>
transform Maeonian mariners, overwhelm<lb/>
them in the ocean, sacrifice a son<lb/>
to his deluded mother, who insane,<lb/>
tears out his entrails; how shall he invent<lb/>
wings for three daughters of King Minyas,<lb/>
while Juno unavenged, bewails despite?—<lb/>
Is it the end? the utmost of my power?<lb/>
His deeds instruct the way; true wisdom heeds<lb/>
an enemy's device; by the strange death<lb/>
of Pentheus, all that madness could perform<lb/>
was well revealed to all; what then denies<lb/>
a frenzy may unravel Ino's course<lb/>
to such a fate as wrought her sisters' woe?”<lb/>

    
A shelving path in shadows of sad yew<lb/>
through utter silence to the deep descends,<lb/>
infernal, where the languid Styx exhales<lb/>
vapours; and there the shadows of the dead,<lb/>
descend, after they leave their sacred urns,<lb/>
and ghostly forms invade: and far and wide,<lb/>
those dreary regions Horror and bleak Cold<lb/>
obtain.<lb/>

    
The ghosts, arrived, not know the way,—<lb/>
which leadeth to the Stygian city-gates,—<lb/>
not know the melancholy palace where<lb/>
the swarthy Pluto stays, though streets and ways<lb/>
a thousand to that city lead, and gates<lb/>
out-swing from every side: and as the sea<lb/>
with never-seen increase engulfs the streams<lb/>
unnumbered of the world, that realm enfolds<lb/>
the souls of men, nor ever is it filled.<lb/>

    
Around the shadowy spirits go; bloodless<lb/>
boneless and bodiless; they throng the place<lb/>
of judgment, or they haunt the mansion where<lb/>
abides the Utmost Tyrant, or they tend<lb/>
to various callings, as their whilom way; —<lb/>
appropriate punishment confines to pain<lb/>
the multitude condemned.<lb/>

    
To this abode,<lb/>
impelled by rage and hate, from habitation<lb/>
celestial, Juno, of Saturn born, descends,<lb/>
submissive to its dreadful element.<lb/>

    
No sooner had she entered the sad gates,<lb/>
than groans were uttered by the threshold, pressed<lb/>
by her immortal form, and Cerberus<lb/>
upraising his three-visaged mouths gave vent<lb/>
to triple-barking howls.—She called to her<lb/>
the sisters, Night-begot, implacable,<lb/>
terrific Furies. They did sit before<lb/>
the prison portals, adamant confined,<lb/>
combing black vipers from their horrid hair.<lb/>

    
When her amid the night-surrounding shades<lb/>
they recognized, those Deities uprose.<lb/>
O dread confines! dark seat of wretched vice!<lb/>
Where stretched athwart nine acres, Tityus,<lb/>
must thou endure thine entrails to be torn!<lb/>
O Tantalus, thou canst not touch the wave,<lb/>
and from thy clutch the hanging branches rise!<lb/>
O Sisyphus, thou canst not stay the stone,<lb/>
catching or pushing, it must fall again!<lb/>
O thou Ixion! whirled around, around,<lb/>
thyself must follow to escape thyself!<lb/>
And, O Belides, (plotter of sad death<lb/>
upon thy cousins) thou art always doomed<lb/>
to dip forever ever-spilling waves!<lb/>

    
When that the daughter of Saturnus fixed<lb/>
a stern look on those wretches, first her glance<lb/>
arrested on Ixion; but the next<lb/>
on Sisyphus; and thus the goddess spoke;—<lb/>

“For why should he alone of all his kin<lb/>
suffer eternal doom, while Athamas,<lb/>
luxurious in a sumptuous palace reigns;<lb/>
and, haughty with his wife, despises me.”<lb/>
So grieved she, and expressed the rage of hate<lb/>
that such descent inspired, beseeching thus,<lb/>
no longer should the House of Cadmus stand,<lb/>
so that the sister Furies plunge in crime<lb/>
overweening Athamas.—Entreating them,<lb/>
she mingled promises with her commands.—<lb/>

    
When Juno ended speech, Tisiphone,<lb/>
whose locks entangled are not ever smooth,<lb/>
tossed them around, that backward from her face<lb/>
such crawling snakes were thrown;—then answered she:<lb/>
“Since what thy will decrees may well be done,<lb/>
why need we to consult with many words?<lb/>
Leave thou this hateful region and convey<lb/>
thyself, contented, to a better realm.”<lb/>

    
Rejoicing Juno hastens to the clouds—<lb/>
before she enters her celestial home,<lb/>
Iris, the child of Thaumas, purifies<lb/>
her limbs in sprinkled water.<lb/>


    
Waiting not,<lb/>
Tisiphone, revengeful, takes a torch;—<lb/>
besmeared with blood, and vested in a robe,<lb/>
dripping with crimson gore, and twisting-snakes<lb/>
engirdled, she departs her dire abode—<lb/>
with twitching Madness, Terror, Fear and Woe:<lb/>
and when she had arrived the destined house,<lb/>
the door-posts shrank from her, the maple doors<lb/>
turned ashen grey: the Sun amazed fled.<lb/>

    
Affrighted, Athamas and Ino viewed<lb/>
and fled these prodigies; but suddenly<lb/>
that baneful Fury stood across the way,<lb/>
blocking the passage— There she stands with arms<lb/>
extended, and alive with twisting vipers.—<lb/>
She shakes her hair; the moving serpents hiss;<lb/>
they cling upon her shoulders, and they glide<lb/>
around her temples, dart their fangs, and vomit<lb/>
corruption.—Plucking from the midst two snakes,<lb/>
she hurls them with her pestilential hand<lb/>
upon her victims, Athamas and Ino, whom,<lb/>
although the vipers strike upon their breasts,<lb/>
no injury attacks their mortal parts;—<lb/>
only their minds are stricken with wild rage,<lb/>
inciting to mad violence and crime.<lb/>

    
And with a monstrous composite of foam—<lb/>
once gathered from the mouth of Cerberus,<lb/>
the venom of Echidna, purposeless<lb/>
aberrances, crimes, tears, hatred—the lust<lb/>
of homicide, and the dark vapourings<lb/>
of foolish brains; a liquid poison, mixed,<lb/>
and mingled with fresh blood, in hollow brass,<lb/>
and boiled, and stirred up with a slip of hemlock—<lb/>
she took of it, and as they trembled, threw<lb/>
that mad-mixed poison on them; and it scorched<lb/>
their inmost vitals—and she waved her torch<lb/>
repeatedly, within a circle's rim—<lb/>
and added flame to flame.—<lb/>

    
Then, confident<lb/>
of having executed her commands,<lb/>
the Fury hastened to the void expanse<lb/>
where Pluto reigns, and swiftly put aside<lb/>
the serpents that were wreathed around her robes.<lb/>

    
At once, the son of Aeolus, enraged,<lb/>
shouts loudly in his palace; “Ho, my lads!<lb/>
Spread out your nets! a savage lioness<lb/>
and her twin whelps are lurking in the wood;—<lb/>
behold them!” In his madness he believes<lb/>
his wife a savage beast. He follows her,<lb/>
and quickly from her bosom snatches up<lb/>
her smiling babe, Learchus, holding forth<lb/>
his tiny arms, and whirls him in the air,<lb/>
times twice and thrice, as whirls the whizzing sling,<lb/>
and dashes him in pieces on the rocks; —<lb/>
cracking his infant bones.<lb/>

    
The mother, roused<lb/>
to frenzy (who can tell if grief the cause,<lb/>
or fires of scattered poison?) yells aloud,<lb/>
and with her torn hair tangled, running mad,<lb/>
she carries swiftly in her clutching arms,<lb/>
her little Melicerta! and begins<lb/>
to shout, “Evoe, Bacche!”—Juno hears<lb/>
the shouted name of Bacchus, and she laughs,<lb/>
and taunts her;—“Let thy foster-child award!”<lb/>

    
There is a crag, out-jutting on the deep,<lb/>
worn hollow at the base by many waves,<lb/>
where not the rain may ripple on that pool;—<lb/>
high up the rugged summit overhangs<lb/>
its ragged brows above the open sea:<lb/>
there, Ino climbs with frenzy-given strength,<lb/>
and fearless, with her burden in her arms,<lb/>
leaps in the waves where whitening foams arise.<lb/>

    
Venus takes pity on her guiltless child,<lb/>
unfortunate grand-daughter, and begins<lb/>
to soothe her uncle Neptune with these words;—<lb/>

“O Neptune, ruler of the deep, to whom,<lb/>
next to the Power in Heaven, was given sway,<lb/>
consider my request! Open thy heart<lb/>
to my descendants, which thine eyes behold,<lb/>
tossed on the wild Ionian Sea! I do implore thee,<lb/>
remember they are thy true Deities—<lb/>
are thine as well as mine—for it is known<lb/>
my birth was from the white foam of thy sea;—<lb/>
a truth made certain by my Grecian name.”<lb/>

    
Neptune regards her prayer: he takes from them<lb/>
their mortal dross: he clothes in majesty,<lb/>
and hallows their appearance. Even their names<lb/>
and forms are altered; Melicerta, changed,<lb/>
is now Palaemon called, and Ino, changed,<lb/>
Leucothoe called, are known as Deities.<lb/>

    
When her Sidonian attendants traced<lb/>
fresh footprints to the last verge of the rock,<lb/>
and found no further vestige, they declared<lb/>
her dead, nor had they any doubt of it.<lb/>
They tore their garments and their hair—and wailed<lb/>
the House of Cadmus— and they cursed at Juno,<lb/>
for the sad fate of the wretched concubine.<lb/>

    
That goddess could no longer brook their words,<lb/>
and thus made answer, “I will make of you<lb/>
eternal monuments of my revenge!”<lb/>

    
Her words were instantly confirmed—The one<lb/>
whose love for Ino was the greatest, cried;<lb/>
“Into the deep; look—look—I seek my queen.”<lb/>
But even as she tried to leap, she stood<lb/>
fast-rooted to the ever-living rock;<lb/>
another, as she tried to beat her breast<lb/>
with blows repeated, noticed that her arms<lb/>
grew stiff and hard; another, as by chance,<lb/>
was petrified with hands stretched over the waves:<lb/>
another could be seen, as suddenly<lb/>
her fingers hardened, clutching at her hair<lb/>
to tear it from the roots.—And each remained<lb/>
forever in the posture first assumed.—<lb/>
But others of those women, sprung from Cadmus,<lb/>
were changed to birds, that always with wide wings<lb/>
skim lightly the dark surface of that sea.<lb/>


Cadmus et Harmonia.
CADMUS AND HARMONIA

Unwitting that his daughter and his son<lb/>
are Ocean deities, Agenor's son,—<lb/>
depressed by sorrow and unnumbered woes,<lb/>
calamities, and prodigies untold,—<lb/>
the founder fled the city he had built,<lb/>
as though fatalities that gathered round<lb/>
that city grieved him deeper than the fate<lb/>
of his own family; and thence, at last<lb/>
arrived the confines of Illyria;<lb/>
in exile with his wife.—<lb/>

    
Weighted with woe,<lb/>
bowed down with years, their minds recalled the time<lb/>
when first disaster fell upon their House:—<lb/>
relating their misfortunes, Cadmus spoke;<lb/>
“Was that a sacred dragon that my spear<lb/>
impaled, when on the way from Sidon's gates<lb/>
I planted in the earth those dragon-teeth,<lb/>
unthought-of seed? If haply 'tis the Gods,<lb/>
(whose rage unerring, gives me to revenge)<lb/>
I only pray that I may lengthen out,<lb/>
as any serpent.” Even as he spoke,<lb/>
he saw and felt himself increase in length.<lb/>
His body coiled into a serpent's form;<lb/>
bright scale's enveloped his indurate skin,<lb/>
and azure macules in speckled pride,<lb/>
enriched his glowing folds; and as he fell<lb/>
supinely on his breast, his legs were joined,<lb/>
and gradually tapered as a serpent's tail.—<lb/>

    
Some time his arms remained, which stretching forth<lb/>
while tears rolled down his human face, not changed<lb/>
as yet, he said; “Hither, O hapless one!<lb/>
Come hither my unhappy wife, while aught<lb/>
is left of manhood; touch me, take my hand,<lb/>
unchanged as yet—ah, soon this serpent-form<lb/>
will cover me!”<lb/>

    
So did he speak, nor thought<lb/>
to make an end; but suddenly his tongue<lb/>
became twin-forked. As often as he tried,<lb/>
a hissing sound escaped; the only voice<lb/>
that Nature left him. —<lb/>

    
And his wife bewailed,<lb/>
and smote her breast, “Ah, Cadmus, ah!<lb/>
Most helpless one, put off that monster-shape!<lb/>
Your feet, your shoulders and your hands are gone;<lb/>
your manly form, your very colour gone; all—all<lb/>
is changed!—Oh, why not, ye celestial Gods,<lb/>
me likewise, to a serpent-shape transform!”—<lb/>

    
So ended her complaint. Cadmus caressed<lb/>
her gently with his tongue; and slid to her<lb/>
dear bosom, just as if he knew his wife;<lb/>
and he embraced her, and he touched her neck.<lb/>

    
All their attendants, who had seen the change,<lb/>
were filled with fear; but when as crested snakes<lb/>
the twain appeared in brightly glistening mail,<lb/>
their grief was lightened: and the pair, enwreathed<lb/>
in twisting coils, departed from that place,<lb/>
and sought a covert in the nearest grove.—<lb/>
There, then, these gentle serpents never shun<lb/>
mankind, nor wound, nor strike with poisoned fangs;<lb/>
for they are always conscious of the past.<lb/>


Perseus. Atlas. Andromeda.
PERSEUS AND ATLAS

The fortune of their grandson, Bacchus, gave<lb/>
great comfort to them—as a god adored<lb/>
in conquered India; by Achaia praised<lb/>
in stately temples. — But Acrisius<lb/>
the son of Abas, of the Cadmean race,<lb/>
remained to banish Bacchus from the walls<lb/>
of Argos, and to lift up hostile arms<lb/>
against that deity, who he denied<lb/>
was born to Jove. He would not even grant<lb/>
that Perseus from the loins of Jupiter<lb/>
was got of Danae in the showering gold.<lb/>

    
So mighty is the hidden power of truth,<lb/>
Acrisius soon lamented that affront<lb/>
to Bacchus, and that ever he refused<lb/>
to own his grandson; for the one achieved<lb/>
high heaven, and the other, (as he bore<lb/>
the viperous monster-head) on sounding wings<lb/>
hovered a conqueror in the fluent air,<lb/>
over sands, Libyan, where the Gorgon-head<lb/>
dropped clots of gore, that, quickening on the ground,<lb/>
became unnumbered serpents; fitting cause<lb/>
to curse with vipers that infested land.<lb/>

    
Thence wafted by the never-constant winds<lb/>
through boundless latitudes, now here now there,<lb/>
as flits a vapour-cloud in dizzy flight,<lb/>
down-looking from the lofty skies on earth,<lb/>
removed far, so compassed he the world.<lb/>

    
Three times did he behold the frozen Bears,<lb/>
times thrice his gaze was on the Crab's bent arms.<lb/>
Now shifting to the west, now to the east,<lb/>
how often changed his course? Time came, when day<lb/>
declining, he began to fear the night,<lb/>
by which he stopped his flight far in the west—<lb/>
the realm of Atlas—where he sought repose<lb/>
till Lucifer might call Aurora's fires;<lb/>
Aurora chariot of the Day.<lb/>

    
There dwelt<lb/>
huge Atlas, vaster than the race of man:<lb/>
son of Iapetus, his lordly sway<lb/>
extended over those extreme domains,<lb/>
and over oceans that command their waves<lb/>
to take the panting coursers of the Sun,<lb/>
and bathe the wearied Chariot of the Day.<lb/>

    
For him a thousand flocks, a thousand herds<lb/>
overwandered pasture fields; and neighbour tribes<lb/>
might none disturb that land. Aglint with gold<lb/>
bright leaves adorn the trees,—boughs golden-wrought<lb/>
bear apples of pure gold. And Perseus spoke<lb/>
to Atlas, “O my friend, if thou art moved<lb/>
to hear the story of a noble race,<lb/>
the author of my life is Jupiter;<lb/>
if valiant deeds perhaps are thy delight<lb/>
mine may deserve thy praise.—Behold of thee<lb/>
kind treatment I implore—a place of rest.”<lb/>

    
But Atlas, mindful of an oracle<lb/>
since by Themis, the Parnassian, told,<lb/>
recalled these words, “O Atlas! mark the day<lb/>
a son of Jupiter shall come to spoil;<lb/>
for when thy trees been stripped of golden fruit,<lb/>
the glory shall be his.”<lb/>

    
Fearful of this,<lb/>
Atlas had built solid walls around<lb/>
his orchard, and secured a dragon, huge,<lb/>
that kept perpetual guard, and thence expelled<lb/>
all strangers from his land. Wherefore he said,<lb/>
“Begone! The glory of your deeds is all<lb/>
pretense; even Jupiter, will fail your need.”<lb/>

    
With that he added force and strove to drive<lb/>
the hesitating Alien from his doors;<lb/>
who pled reprieve or threatened with bold words.<lb/>
Although he dared not rival Atlas' might,<lb/>
Perseus made this reply; “For that my love<lb/>
you hold in light esteem, let this be yours.”<lb/>
He said no more, but turning his own face,<lb/>
he showed upon his left Medusa's head,<lb/>
abhorrent features.—Atlas, huge and vast,<lb/>
becomes a mountain—His great beard and hair<lb/>
are forests, and his shoulders and his hands<lb/>
mountainous ridges, and his head the top<lb/>
of a high peak;—his bones are changed to rocks.<lb/>

    
Augmented on all sides, enormous height<lb/>
attains his growth; for so ordained it, ye,<lb/>
O mighty Gods! who now the heavens' expanse<lb/>
unnumbered stars, on him command to rest.<lb/>

PERSEUS AND ANDROMEDA

In their eternal prison, Aeous,<lb/>
grandson of Hippotas, had shut the winds;<lb/>
and Lucifer, reminder of our toil,<lb/>
in splendour rose upon the lofty sky:<lb/>
and Perseus bound his wings upon his feet,<lb/>
on each foot bound he them; his sword he girt<lb/>
and sped wing-footed through the liquid air.<lb/>

    
Innumerous kingdoms far behind were left,<lb/>
till peoples Ethiopic and the lands<lb/>
of Cepheus were beneath his lofty view.<lb/>

    
There Ammon, the Unjust, had made decree<lb/>
Andromeda, the Innocent, should grieve<lb/>
her mother's tongue. They bound her fettered arms<lb/>
fast to the rock. When Perseus her beheld<lb/>
as marble he would deem her, but the breeze<lb/>
moved in her hair, and from her streaming eyes<lb/>
the warm tears fell. Her beauty so amazed<lb/>
his heart, unconscious captive of her charms,<lb/>
that almost his swift wings forgot to wave.—<lb/>

    
Alighted on the ground, he thus began;<lb/>
“O fairest! whom these chains become not so,<lb/>
but worthy are for links that lovers bind,<lb/>
make known to me your country's name and your's<lb/>
and wherefore bound in chains.” A moment then,<lb/>
as overcome with shame, she made no sound:<lb/>
were not she fettered she would surely hide<lb/>
her blushing head; but what she could perform<lb/>
that did she do—she filled her eyes with tears.<lb/>

    
So pleaded he that lest refusal seem<lb/>
implied confession of a crime, she told<lb/>
her name, her country's name, and how her charms<lb/>
had been her mother's pride. But as she spoke<lb/>
the mighty ocean roared. Over the waves<lb/>
a monster fast approached, its head held high,<lb/>
abreast the wide expanse.—The virgin shrieked;—<lb/>
no aid her wretched father gave, nor aid<lb/>
her still more wretched mother; but they wept<lb/>
and mingled lamentations with their tears—<lb/>
clinging distracted to her fettered form.<lb/>

    
And thus the stranger spoke to them, “Time waits<lb/>
for tears, but flies the moment of our need:<lb/>
were I, who am the son of Regal Jove<lb/>
and her whom he embraced in showers of gold,<lb/>
leaving her pregnant in her brazen cell, —<lb/>
I, Perseus, who destroyed the Gorgon, wreathed<lb/>
with snake-hair, I, who dared on waving wings<lb/>
to cleave etherial air—were I to ask<lb/>
the maid in marriage, I should be preferred<lb/>
above all others as your son-in-law.<lb/>
Not satisfied with deeds achieved, I strive<lb/>
to add such merit as the Gods permit;<lb/>
now, therefore, should my velour save her life,<lb/>
be it conditioned that I win her love.”<lb/>

    
To this her parents gave a glad assent,<lb/>
for who could hesitate? And they entreat,<lb/>
and promise him the kingdom as a dower.<lb/>


    
As a great ship with steady prow speeds on;<lb/>
forced forwards by the sweating arms of youth<lb/>
it plows the deep; so, breasting the great waves,<lb/>
the monster moved, until to reach the rock<lb/>
no further space remained than might the whirl<lb/>
of Balearic string encompass, through<lb/>
the middle skies, with plummet-mold of lead.<lb/>

    
That instant, spurning with his feet the ground,<lb/>
the youth rose upwards to a cloudy height;<lb/>
and when the shadow of the hero marked<lb/>
the surface of the sea, the monster sought<lb/>
vainly to vent his fury on the shade.<lb/>

    
As the swift bird of Jove, when he beholds<lb/>
a basking serpent in an open field,<lb/>
exposing to the sun its mottled back,<lb/>
and seizes on its tail; lest it shall turn<lb/>
to strike with venomed fang, he fixes fast<lb/>
his grasping talons in the scaly neck;<lb/>
so did the winged youth, in rapid flight<lb/>
through yielding elements, press down<lb/>
on the great monster's back, and thrust his sword,<lb/>
sheer to the hilt, in its right shoulder—loud<lb/>
its frightful torture sounded over the waves.—<lb/>
So fought the hero-son of Inachus.<lb/>

    
Wild with the grievous wound, the monster rears<lb/>
high in the air, or plunges in the waves;—<lb/>
or wheels around as turns the frightened boar<lb/>
shunning the hounds around him in full cry.<lb/>

    
The hero on his active wings avoids<lb/>
the monster's jaws, and with his crooked sword<lb/>
tortures its back wherever he may pierce<lb/>
its mail of hollow shell, or strikes betwixt<lb/>
the ribs each side, or wounds its lashing tail,<lb/>
long, tapered as a fish.<lb/>

    
The monster spouts<lb/>
forth streams—incarnadined with blood—<lb/>
that spray upon the hero's wings; who drenched,<lb/>
and heavy with the spume, no longer dares<lb/>
to trust existence to his dripping wings;<lb/>
but he discerns a rock, which rises clear<lb/>
above the water when the sea is calm,<lb/>
but now is covered by the lashing waves.<lb/>
On this he rests; and as his left hand holds<lb/>
firm on the upmost ledge, he thrusts his sword,<lb/>
times more than three, unswerving in his aim,<lb/>
sheer through the monster's entrails.—Shouts of praise<lb/>
resound along the shores, and even the Gods<lb/>
may hear his glory in their high abodes.<lb/>

    
Her parents, Cepheus and Cassiope,<lb/>
most joyfully salute their son-in-law;<lb/>
declaring him the saviour of their house.<lb/>
And now, her chains struck off, the lovely cause<lb/>
and guerdon of his toil, walks on the shore.<lb/>

    
The hero washes his victorious hands<lb/>
in water newly taken from the sea:<lb/>
but lest the sand upon the shore might harm<lb/>
the viper-covered head, he first prepared<lb/>
a bed of springy leaves, on which he threw<lb/>
weeds of the sea, produced beneath the waves.<lb/>
On them he laid Medusa's awful face,<lb/>
daughter of Phorcys;—and the living weeds,<lb/>
fresh taken from the boundless deep, imbibed<lb/>
the monster's poison in their spongy pith:<lb/>
they hardened at the touch, and felt in branch<lb/>
and leaf unwonted stiffness. Sea-Nymphs, too,<lb/>
attempted to perform that prodigy<lb/>
on numerous other weeds, with like result:<lb/>
so pleased at their success, they raised new seeds,<lb/>
from plants wide-scattered on the salt expanse.<lb/>

    
Even from that day the coral has retained<lb/>
such wondrous nature, that exposed to air<lb/>
it hardens.—Thus, a plant beneath the waves<lb/>
becomes a stone when taken from the sea.<lb/>

    
Three altars to three Gods he made of turf.<lb/>
To thee, victorious Virgin, did he build<lb/>
an altar on the right, to Mercury<lb/>
an altar on the left, and unto Jove<lb/>
an altar in the midst. He sacrificed<lb/>
a heifer to Minerva, and a calf<lb/>
to Mercury, the Wingfoot, and a bull<lb/>
to thee, O greatest of the Deities.<lb/>

    
Without a dower he takes Andromeda,<lb/>
the guerdon of his glorious victory,<lb/>
nor hesitates.—Now pacing in the van,<lb/>
both Love and Hymen wave the flaring torch,<lb/>
abundant perfumes lavished in the flames.<lb/>

    
The houses are bedecked with wreathed flowers;<lb/>
and lyres and flageolets resound, and songs—<lb/>
felicit notes that happy hearts declare.<lb/>
The portals opened, sumptuous halls display<lb/>
their golden splendours, and the noble lords<lb/>
of Cepheus' court take places at the feast,<lb/>
magnificently served.<lb/>

    
After the feast,<lb/>
when every heart was warming to the joys of genial Bacchus,<lb/>
then, Lyncidian Perseus asked about the land and its ways<lb/>
about the customs and the character of its heroes.<lb/>
Straightway one of the dinner-companions made reply,<lb/>
and asked in turn, “ Now, valiant Perseus, pray<lb/>
tell the story of the deed, that all may know,<lb/>
and what the arts and power prevailed, when you<lb/>
struck off the serpent-covered head.”<lb/>

    
“There is,”<lb/>
continued Perseus of the house of Agenor,<lb/>
“There is a spot beneath cold Atlas, where<lb/>
in bulwarks of enormous strength, to guard<lb/>
its rocky entrance, dwelt two sisters, born<lb/>
of Phorcys. These were wont to share in turn<lb/>
a single eye between them: this by craft<lb/>
I got possession of, when one essayed<lb/>
to hand it to the other.—I put forth<lb/>
my hand and took it as it passed between:<lb/>
then, far, remote, through rocky pathless crags,<lb/>
over wild hills that bristled with great woods,<lb/>
I thence arrived to where the Gorgon dwelt.<lb/>

    
“Along the way, in fields and by the roads,<lb/>
I saw on all sides men and animals—<lb/>
like statues—turned to flinty stone at sight<lb/>
of dread Medusa's visage. Nevertheless<lb/>
reflected on the brazen shield, I bore<lb/>
upon my left, I saw her horrid face.<lb/>

    
“When she was helpless in the power of sleep<lb/>
and even her serpent-hair was slumber-bound,<lb/>
I struck, and took her head sheer from the neck.—<lb/>
To winged Pegasus the blood gave birth,<lb/>
his brother also, twins of rapid wing.”<lb/>

    
So did he speak, and truly told besides<lb/>
the perils of his journey, arduous<lb/>
and long—He told of seas and lands that far<lb/>
beneath him he had seen, and of the stars<lb/>
that he had touched while on his waving wings.<lb/>

    
And yet, before they were aware, the tale<lb/>
was ended; he was silent. Then rejoined<lb/>
a noble with enquiry why alone<lb/>
of those three sisters, snakes were interspersed<lb/>
in dread Medusa's locks. And he replied:—<lb/>

“Because, O Stranger, it is your desire<lb/>
to learn what worthy is for me to tell,<lb/>
hear ye the cause: Beyond all others she<lb/>
was famed for beauty, and the envious hope<lb/>
of many suitors. Words would fail to tell<lb/>
the glory of her hair, most wonderful<lb/>
of all her charms—A friend declared to me<lb/>
he saw its lovely splendour. Fame declares<lb/>
the Sovereign of the Sea attained her love<lb/>
in chaste Minerva's temple. While enraged<lb/>
she turned her head away and held her shield<lb/>
before her eyes. To punish that great crime<lb/>
minerva changed the Gorgon's splendid hair<lb/>
to serpents horrible. And now to strike<lb/>
her foes with fear, she wears upon her breast<lb/>
those awful vipers—creatures of her rage.<lb/>

Pallas et Arachne.
ARACHNE AND MINERVA

All this Minerva heard; and she approved<lb/>
their songs and their resentment; but her heart<lb/>
was brooding thus, “It is an easy thing<lb/>
to praise another, I should do as they:<lb/>
no creature of the earth should ever slight<lb/>
the majesty that dwells in me,—without<lb/>
just retribution.”—So her thought was turned<lb/>
upon the fortune of Arachne — proud,<lb/>
who would not ever yield to her the praise<lb/>
won by the art of deftly weaving wool,<lb/>
a girl who had not fame for place of birth,<lb/>
nor fame for birth, but only fame for skill!<lb/>

    
For it was well known that her father dwelt<lb/>
in Colophon; where, at his humble trade,<lb/>
he dyed in Phocean purples, fleecy wool.<lb/>
Her mother, also of the lower class,<lb/>
had died. Arachne in a mountain town<lb/>
by skill had grown so famous in the Land<lb/>
of Lydia, that unnumbered curious nymphs<lb/>
eager to witness her dexterity,<lb/>
deserted the lush vineyards of Timolus;<lb/>
or even left the cool and flowing streams<lb/>
of bright Pactolus, to admire the cloth,<lb/>
or to observe her deftly spinning wool.<lb/>

    
So graceful was her motion then,—if she<lb/>
was twisting the coarse wool in little balls,<lb/>
or if she teased it with her finger-tips,<lb/>
or if she softened the fine fleece, drawn forth<lb/>
in misty films, or if she twirled the smooth<lb/>
round spindle with her energetic thumb,<lb/>
or if with needle she embroidered cloth;—<lb/>

    
in all her motions one might well perceive<lb/>
how much Minerva had instructed her:<lb/>
but this she ever would deny, displeased<lb/>
to share her fame; and said, “Let her contend<lb/>
in art with me; and if her skill prevails,<lb/>
I then will forfeit all!”<lb/>

    
Minerva heard,<lb/>
and came to her, disguised with long grey hair,<lb/>
and with a staff to steady her weak limbs.<lb/>
She seemed a feeble woman, very old,<lb/>
and quavered as she said, “Old age is not<lb/>
the cause of every ill; experience comes<lb/>
with lengthened years; and, therefore, you should not<lb/>
despise my words. It is no harm in you<lb/>
to long for praise of mortals, when<lb/>
your nimble hands are spinning the soft wool,—<lb/>
but you should not deny Minerva's art—<lb/>
and you should pray that she may pardon you,<lb/>
for she will grant you pardon if you ask.”<lb/>

    
Arachne, scowling with an evil face.<lb/>
Looked at the goddess, as she dropped her thread.<lb/>
She hardly could restrain her threatening hand,<lb/>
and, trembling in her anger, she replied<lb/>
to you, disguised Minerva:<lb/>

    
“Silly fool,—<lb/>
worn out and witless in your palsied age,<lb/>
a great age is your great misfortune!— Let<lb/>
your daughter and your son's wife—if the Gods<lb/>
have blessed you—let them profit by your words;<lb/>
within myself, my knowledge is contained<lb/>
sufficient; you need not believe that your<lb/>
advice does any good; for I am quite<lb/>
unchanged in my opinion. Get you gone,—<lb/>
advise your goddess to come here herself,<lb/>
and not avoid the contest!”<lb/>

    
Instantly,<lb/>
the goddess said, “Minerva comes to you!”<lb/>
And with those brief words, put aside the shape<lb/>
of the old woman, and revealed herself,<lb/>
Minerva, goddess.<lb/>

    
All the other Nymphs<lb/>
and matrons of Mygdonia worshiped her;<lb/>
but not Arachne, who defiant stood;—<lb/>
although at first she flushed up—then went pale—<lb/>
then blushed again, reluctant.—So, at first,<lb/>
the sky suffuses, as Aurora moves,<lb/>
and, quickly when the glorious sun comes up,<lb/>
pales into white.<lb/>

    
She even rushed upon<lb/>
her own destruction, for she would not give<lb/>
from her desire to gain the victory.<lb/>
Nor did the daughter of almighty Jove<lb/>
decline: disdaining to delay with words,<lb/>
she hesitated not.<lb/>

    
And both, at once,<lb/>
selected their positions, stretched their webs<lb/>
with finest warp, and separated warp with sley.<lb/>
The woof was next inserted in the web<lb/>
by means of the sharp shuttles, which<lb/>
their nimble fingers pushed along, so drawn<lb/>
within the warp, and so the teeth notched in<lb/>
the moving sley might strike them.—Both, in haste,<lb/>
girded their garments to their breasts and moved<lb/>
their skilful arms, beguiling their fatigue<lb/>
in eager action.<lb/>

    
Myriad tints appeared<lb/>
besides the Tyrian purple—royal dye,<lb/>
extracted in brass vessels.—As the bow,<lb/>
that spans new glory in the curving sky,<lb/>
its glittering rays reflected in the rain,<lb/>
spreads out a multitude of blended tints,<lb/>
in scintillating beauty to the sight<lb/>
of all who gaze upon it; — so the threads,<lb/>
inwoven, mingled in a thousand tints,<lb/>
harmonious and contrasting; shot with gold:<lb/>
and there, depicted in those shining webs,<lb/>
were shown the histories of ancient days:—<lb/>

    
Minerva worked the Athenian Hill of Mars,<lb/>
where ancient Cecrops built his citadel,<lb/>
and showed the old contention for the name<lb/>
it should be given.—Twelve celestial Gods<lb/>
surrounded Jupiter, on lofty thrones;<lb/>
and all their features were so nicely drawn,<lb/>
that each could be distinguished.—Jupiter<lb/>
appeared as monarch of those judging Gods.<lb/>

    
There Neptune, guardian of the sea, was shown<lb/>
contending with Minerva. As he struck<lb/>
the Rock with his long trident, a wild horse<lb/>
sprang forth which he bequeathed to man. He claimed<lb/>
his right to name the city for that gift.<lb/>

    
And then she wove a portrait of herself,<lb/>
bearing a shield, and in her hand a lance,<lb/>
sharp-pointed, and a helmet on her head—<lb/>
her breast well-guarded by her Aegis: there<lb/>
she struck her spear into the fertile earth,<lb/>
from which a branch of olive seemed to sprout,<lb/>
pale with new clustered fruits.—And those twelve Gods,<lb/>
appeared to judge, that olive as a gift<lb/>
surpassed the horse which Neptune gave to man.<lb/>

    
And, so Arachne, rival of her fame,<lb/>
might learn the folly of her mad attempt,<lb/>
from the great deeds of ancient histories,<lb/>
and what award presumption must expect,<lb/>
Minerva wove four corners with life scenes<lb/>
of contest, brightly colored, but of size<lb/>
diminutive.<lb/>


    
In one of these was shown<lb/>
the snow-clad mountains, Rhodope,<lb/>
and Haemus, which for punishment were changed<lb/>
from human beings to those rigid forms,<lb/>
when they aspired to rival the high Gods.<lb/>
And in another corner she described<lb/>
that Pygmy, whom the angry Juno changed<lb/>
from queen-ship to a crane; because she thought<lb/>
herself an equal of the living Gods,<lb/>
she was commanded to wage cruel wars<lb/>
upon her former subjects. In the third,<lb/>
she wove the story of Antigone,<lb/>
who dared compare herself to Juno, queen<lb/>
of Jupiter, and showed her as she was<lb/>
transformed into a silly chattering stork,<lb/>
that praised her beauty, with her ugly beak.—<lb/>
Despite the powers of Ilion and her sire<lb/>
Laomedon, her shoulders fledged white wings.<lb/>
And so, the third part finished, there was left<lb/>
one corner, where Minerva deftly worked<lb/>
the story of the father, Cinyras;—<lb/>
as he was weeping on the temple steps,<lb/>
which once had been his daughter's living limbs.<lb/>
And she adorned the border with designs<lb/>
of peaceful olive—her devoted tree—<lb/>
which having shown, she made an end of work.<lb/>

    
Arachne, of Maeonia, wove, at first<lb/>
the story of Europa, as the bull<lb/>
deceived her, and so perfect was her art,<lb/>
it seemed a real bull in real waves.<lb/>
Europa seemed to look back towards the land<lb/>
which she had left; and call in her alarm<lb/>
to her companions—and as if she feared<lb/>
the touch of dashing waters, to draw up<lb/>
her timid feet, while she was sitting on<lb/>
the bull's back.<lb/>

    
And she wove Asteria seized<lb/>
by the assaulting eagle; and beneath the swan's<lb/>
white wings showed Leda lying by the stream:<lb/>

    
and showed Jove dancing as a Satyr, when<lb/>
he sought the beautiful Antiope,<lb/>
to whom was given twins; and how he seemed<lb/>
Amphitryon when he deceived Alcmena;<lb/>
and how he courted lovely Danae<lb/>
luring her as a gleaming shower of gold;<lb/>
and poor Aegina, hidden in his flame,<lb/>
jove as a shepherd with Mnemosyne;<lb/>
and beautiful Proserpina, involved<lb/>
by him, apparent as a spotted snake.<lb/>

    
And in her web, Arachne wove the scenes<lb/>
of Neptune:—who was shown first as a bull,<lb/>
when he was deep in love with virgin Arne<lb/>
then as Enipeus when the giant twins,<lb/>
Aloidae, were begot; and as the ram<lb/>
that gambolled with Bisaltis; as a horse<lb/>
loved by the fruitful Ceres, golden haired,<lb/>
all-bounteous mother of the yellow grain;<lb/>
and as the bird that hovered round snake-haired<lb/>
Medusa, mother of the winged horse;<lb/>
and as the dolphin, sporting with the Nymph,<lb/>
Melantho.—All of these were woven true<lb/>
to life, in proper shades.<lb/>

    
And there she showed<lb/>
Apollo, when disguised in various forms:<lb/>
as when he seemed a rustic; and as when<lb/>
he wore hawk-wings, and then the tawny skin<lb/>
of a great lion; and once more when he<lb/>
deluded Isse, as a shepherd lad.<lb/>

    
And there was Bacchus, when he was disguised<lb/>
as a large cluster of fictitious grapes;<lb/>
deluding by that wile the beautiful<lb/>
Erigone;—and Saturn, as a steed,<lb/>
begetter of the dual-natured Chiron.<lb/>

    
And then Arachne, to complete her work,<lb/>
wove all around the web a patterned edge<lb/>
of interlacing flowers and ivy leaves.<lb/>

    
Minerva could not find a fleck or flaw—<lb/>
even Envy can not censure perfect art—<lb/>
enraged because Arachne had such skill<lb/>
she ripped the web, and ruined all the scenes<lb/>
that showed those wicked actions of the Gods;<lb/>
and with her boxwood shuttle in her hand,<lb/>
struck the unhappy mortal on her head,—<lb/>
struck sharply thrice, and even once again.<lb/>

    
Arachne's spirit, deigning not to brook<lb/>
such insult, brooded on it, till she tied<lb/>
a cord around her neck, and hung herself.<lb/>

    
Minerva, moved to pity at the sight,<lb/>
sustained and saved her from that bitter death;<lb/>
but, angry still, pronounced another doom:<lb/>
“Although I grant you life, most wicked one,<lb/>
your fate shall be to dangle on a cord,<lb/>
and your posterity forever shall<lb/>
take your example, that your punishment<lb/>
may last forever!” Even as she spoke,<lb/>
before withdrawing from her victim's sight,<lb/>
she sprinkled her with juice—extract of herbs<lb/>
of Hecate.<lb/>

    
At once all hair fell off,<lb/>
her nose and ears remained not, and her head<lb/>
shrunk rapidly in size, as well as all<lb/>
her body, leaving her diminutive.—<lb/>
Her slender fingers gathered to her sides<lb/>
as long thin legs; and all her other parts<lb/>
were fast absorbed in her abdomen—whence<lb/>
she vented a fine thread;—and ever since,<lb/>
Arachne, as a spider, weaves her web.<lb/>


Niobe.
NIOBE

All Lydia was astonished at her fate<lb/>
the Rumor spread to Phrygia, soon the world<lb/>
was filled with fear and wonder. Niobe<lb/>
had known her long before,—when in Maeonia<lb/>
near to Mount Sipylus; but the sad fate<lb/>
which overtook Arachne, lost on her,<lb/>
she never ceased her boasting and refused<lb/>
to honor the great Gods.<lb/>

    
So many things<lb/>
increased her pride: She loved to boast<lb/>
her husband's skill, their noble family,<lb/>
the rising grandeur of their kingdom. Such<lb/>
felicities were great delights to her;<lb/>
but nothing could exceed the haughty way<lb/>
she boasted of her children: and, in truth,<lb/>
Niobe might have been adjudged on earth,<lb/>
the happiest mother of mankind, if pride<lb/>
had not destroyed her wit.<lb/>

    
It happened then,<lb/>
that Manto, daughter of Tiresias,<lb/>
who told the future; when she felt the fire<lb/>
of prophecy descend upon her, rushed<lb/>
upon the street and shouted in the midst:<lb/>

    
“You women of Ismenus! go and give<lb/>
to high Latona and her children, twain,<lb/>
incense and prayer. Go, and with laurel wreathe<lb/>
your hair in garlands, as your sacred prayers<lb/>
arise to heaven. Give heed, for by my speech<lb/>
Latona has ordained these holy rites.”<lb/>

    
At once, the Theban women wreathe their brows<lb/>
with laurel, and they cast in hallowed flame<lb/>
the grateful incense, while they supplicate<lb/>
all favors of the ever-living Gods.<lb/>

    
And while they worship, Niobe comes there,<lb/>
surrounded with a troup that follow her,<lb/>
and most conspicuous in her purple robe,<lb/>
bright with inwoven threads of yellow gold.<lb/>
Beautiful in her anger, she tosses back<lb/>
her graceful head. The glory of her hair<lb/>
shines on her shoulders. Standing forth,<lb/>
she looks upon them with her haughty eyes,<lb/>
and taunts them, “Madness has prevailed on you<lb/>
to worship some imagined Gods of Heaven,<lb/>
which you have only heard of; but the Gods<lb/>
that truly are on earth, and can be seen,<lb/>
are all neglected! Come, explain to me,<lb/>
why is Latona worshiped and adored,<lb/>
and frankincense not offered unto me?<lb/>
For my divinity is known to you.<lb/>

    
“Tantalus was my father, who alone<lb/>
approached the tables of the Gods in heaven;<lb/>
my mother, sister of the Pleiades,<lb/>
was daughter of huge Atlas, who supports<lb/>
the world upon his shoulders; I can boast<lb/>
of Jupiter as father of my sire,<lb/>
I count him also as my father-in-law.<lb/>
The peoples of my Phrygia dread my power,<lb/>
and I am mistress of the palace built<lb/>
by Cadmus. By my husband, I am queen<lb/>
of those great walls that reared themselves<lb/>
to the sweet music of his sounding lyre.<lb/>
We rule together all the people they<lb/>
encompass and defend. And everywhere<lb/>
my gaze is turned, an evidence of wealth<lb/>
is witnessed.<lb/>

    
“In my features you can see<lb/>
the beauty of a goddess, but above<lb/>
that majesty is all the glory due<lb/>
to me, the mother of my seven sons<lb/>
and daughters seven. And the time will come<lb/>
when by their marriage they will magnify<lb/>
the circle of my power invincible.<lb/>

    
“All must acknowledge my just cause of pride<lb/>
and must no longer worship, in despite<lb/>
of my superior birth, this deity,<lb/>
a daughter of ignoble Coeus, whom<lb/>
one time the great Earth would not even grant<lb/>
sufficient space for travail: whom the Heavens,<lb/>
the Land, the Sea together once compelled<lb/>
to wander, hopeless on all hostile shores!<lb/>
Throughout the world she found herself rebuffed,<lb/>
till Delos, sorry for the vagrant, said,<lb/>
‘Homeless you roam the lands, and I the seas!’<lb/>
And even her refuge always was adrift.<lb/>

    
“And there she bore two children, who, compared<lb/>
with mine, are but as one to seven. Who<lb/>
denies my fortunate condition?—Who<lb/>
can doubt my future?—I am surely safe.<lb/>

    
“The wealth of my abundance is too strong<lb/>
for Fortune to assail me. Let her rage<lb/>
despoil me of large substance; yet so much<lb/>
would still be mine, for I have risen above<lb/>
the blight of apprehension. But, suppose<lb/>
a few of my fair children should be taken!<lb/>
Even so deprived, I could not be reduced<lb/>
to only two, as this Latona, who,<lb/>
might quite as well be childless.—Get you gone<lb/>
from this insensate sacrifice. Make haste!<lb/>
Cast off the wreathing laurels from your brows!”<lb/>

    
They plucked the garlands from their hair, and left<lb/>
the sacrifice, obedient to her will,<lb/>
although in gentle murmurs they adored<lb/>
the goddess Niobe had so defamed.<lb/>

    
Latona, furious when she heard the speech,<lb/>
flew swiftly to the utmost peak of Cynthus,<lb/>
and spoke to her two children in these words:<lb/>

    
“Behold your mother, proud of having borne<lb/>
such glorious children! I will yield<lb/>
prestige before no goddess—save alone<lb/>
immortal Juno! I have been debased,<lb/>
and driven for all ages from my own—<lb/>
my altars, unto me devoted long,<lb/>
and so must languish through eternity,<lb/>
unless by you sustained. Nor is this all;.<lb/>
That daughter of Tantalus, bold Niobe,<lb/>
has added curses to her evil deeds,<lb/>
and with a tongue as wicked as her sire's,<lb/>
has raised her base-born children over mine.<lb/>
Has even called me childless! A sad fate<lb/>
more surely should be hers! Oh, I entreat”—<lb/>

    
But Phoebus answered her, “No more complaint<lb/>
is necessary, for it only serves<lb/>
to hinder the swift sequel of her doom.”<lb/>
And with the same words Phoebe answered her.<lb/>
And having spoken, they descended through<lb/>
the shielding shadows of surrounding clouds,<lb/>
and hovered on the citadel of Cadmus.<lb/>


    
There, far below them, was a level plain<lb/>
which swept around those walls; where trampling steeds,<lb/>
with horny hoofs, and multitudinous wheels,<lb/>
had beaten a wide track. And on the field<lb/>
the older sons of Niobe on steeds<lb/>
emblazoned with bright dyes and harness rich<lb/>
with studded gold were circling.—One of these,<lb/>
Ismenus, first-born of his mother, while<lb/>
controlling his fleet courser's foaming mouth,<lb/>
cried out, “Ah wretched me!” A shaft had pierced<lb/>
the middle of his breast; and as the reins<lb/>
dropped slowly on the rapid courser's neck,<lb/>
his drooping form fell forward to the ground.<lb/>

    
Not far from him, his brother, Sipylus,<lb/>
could hear the whistling of a fatal shaft,<lb/>
and in his fright urged on the plunging steed:<lb/>
as when the watchful pilot, sensible<lb/>
of storms approaching, crowds on sail,<lb/>
hoping to catch a momentary breeze,<lb/>
so fled he, urging an impetuous flight;<lb/>
but, while he fled the shaft, unerring, flew;<lb/>
transfixed him with its quivering death; struck where<lb/>
the neck supports the head and the sharp point<lb/>
protruded from his throat. In his swift flight,<lb/>
as he was leaning forward, he was struck;<lb/>
and, rolling over the wild horse's neck<lb/>
pitched to the ground, and stained it with his blood.<lb/>

    
Unhappy Phaedimus, and Tantalus,<lb/>
(So named from his maternal grandsire) now<lb/>
had finished coursing on the track, and smooth.<lb/>
Shining with oil, were wrestling in the field;<lb/>
and while those brothers struggled—breast to breast—<lb/>
another arrow, hurtling from the sky,<lb/>
pierced them together, just as they were clinched.<lb/>
The mingled sound that issued from two throats<lb/>
was like a single groan. Convulsed with pain,<lb/>
the wrestlers fell together on the ground,<lb/>
where, stricken with a double agony,<lb/>
rolling their eyeballs, they sobbed out their lives.<lb/>

    
Alphenor saw them die—beating his breast<lb/>
in agony—ran to lift in his arms<lb/>
their lifeless bodies cold—while doing this<lb/>
he fell upon them. Phoebus struck him so,<lb/>
piercing his midriff in a vital part,<lb/>
with fatal shot, which, when he pulled it forth,<lb/>
dragged with its barb a torn clot of his lung—<lb/>
his blood and life poured out upon the air.<lb/>

    
The youthful Damasicthon next was struck,<lb/>
not only once; an arrow pierced his leg<lb/>
just where the sinews of the thigh begin,<lb/>
and as he turned and stooped to pluck it out,<lb/>
another keen shaft shot into his neck,<lb/>
up to the fletching.—The blood drove it out,<lb/>
and spouted after it in crimson jets.<lb/>

    
Then, Ilioneus, last of seven sons,<lb/>
lifted his unavailing arms in prayer,<lb/>
and cried, “O Universal Deities,<lb/>
gods of eternal heaven, spare my life!”—<lb/>
Besought too late, Apollo of the Bow,<lb/>
could not prevail against the deadly shaft,<lb/>
already on its way: and yet his will,<lb/>
compellant, acted to retard its flight,<lb/>
so that it cut no deeper than his heart.<lb/>

    
The rumors of an awful tragedy,—<lb/>
the wailings of sad Niobe's loved friends,—<lb/>
the terror of her grieving relatives,—<lb/>
all gave some knowledge of her sudden loss:<lb/>
but so bewildered and enraged her mind,<lb/>
that she could hardly realize the Gods<lb/>
had privilege to dare against her might.<lb/>
Nor would she, till her lord, Amphion, thrust<lb/>
his sword deep in his breast, by which his life<lb/>
and anguish both were ended in dark night.<lb/>

    
Alas, proud Niobe, once haughty queen!<lb/>
Proud Niobe who but so lately drove<lb/>
her people from Latona's altars, while,<lb/>
moving majestic through the midst, she hears<lb/>
their plaudits, now so bitterly debased,<lb/>
her meanest enemy may pity her!—<lb/>

    
She fell upon the bodies of her sons,<lb/>
and in a frenzy of maternal grief,<lb/>
kissed their unfeeling lips. Then unto Heaven<lb/>
with arms accusing, railed upon her foe:<lb/>

“Glut your revenge! Latona, glut your rage!<lb/>
Yea, let my lamentations be your joy!<lb/>
Go—satiate your flinty heart with death!<lb/>
Are not my seven sons all dead? Am I<lb/>
not waiting to be carried to my grave?—<lb/>
exult and triumph, my victorious foe!<lb/>
Victorious? Nay!—Much more remains to me<lb/>
in all my utmost sorrow, than to you,<lb/>
you gloater upon vengeance—Undismayed,<lb/>
I stand victorious in my Field of Woe!”<lb/>

    
no sooner had she spoken, than the cord<lb/>
twanged from the ever-ready bow; and all<lb/>
who heard the fatal sound, again were filled<lb/>
with fear,—save Niobe, in misery bold,—<lb/>
defiant in misfortune.—Clothed in black,<lb/>
the sisters of the stricken brothers stood,<lb/>
with hair disheveled, by the funeral biers.<lb/>

    
And one while plucking from her brother's heart<lb/>
a shaft, swooned unto death, fell on her face—<lb/>
on her dear brother's corpse. Another girl,<lb/>
while she consoled her mother, suddenly,<lb/>
was stricken with an unseen, deadly wound;<lb/>
and doubled in convulsions, closed her lips,<lb/>
tight held them, till both breath and life were lost.<lb/>
Another, vainly rushed away from death—<lb/>
she met it, and pitched head-first to the ground;<lb/>
and still another died upon her corse,<lb/>
another vainly sought a secret death,<lb/>
and, then another slipped beyond's life's edge.<lb/>
So, altogether, six of seven died—<lb/>
each victim, strickened in a different way.<lb/>

    
One child remained. Then in a frenzy-fear<lb/>
the mother, as she covered her with all<lb/>
her garments and her body, wailed—“Oh, leave<lb/>
me this one child! the youngest of them all!<lb/>
My darling daughter—only leave me one!”<lb/>
But even while she was entreating for its life—<lb/>
the life was taken from her only child.<lb/>

    
Childless— she crouched beside her slaughtered sons,<lb/>
her lifeless daughters, and her husband's corpse.<lb/>
The breeze not even moved her fallen hair,<lb/>
a chill of marble spread upon her flesh,<lb/>
beneath her pale, set brows, her eyes moved not,<lb/>
her bitter tongue turned stiff in her hard jaws,<lb/>
her lovely veins congealed, and her stiff neck<lb/>
and rigid hands could neither bend nor move.—<lb/>
her limbs and body, all were changed to stone.<lb/>

    
Yet ever would she weep: and as her tears<lb/>
were falling she was carried from the place,<lb/>
enveloped in a storm and mighty wind,<lb/>
far, to her native land, where fixed upon<lb/>
a mountain summit she dissolves in tears,—<lb/>
and to this day the marble drips with tears.<lb/>


Agrestes Lycii.
RUSTICS CHANGED TO FROGS

All men and women, after this event,<lb/>
feared to incur Latona's fateful wrath,<lb/>
and worshiped with more zeal the Deity,<lb/>
mother of twins.—And, as it is the way<lb/>
of men to talk of many other things<lb/>
after a strong occurrence, they recalled<lb/>
what other deeds the goddess had performed;—<lb/>
and one of them recited this event:<lb/>

    
'Twas in the ancient days of long-ago,—<lb/>
some rustics, in the fertile fields of Lycia,<lb/>
heedless, insulted the goddess to their harm:—<lb/>
perhaps you've never heard of this event,<lb/>
because those country clowns were little known.<lb/>
The event was wonderful, but I can vouch<lb/>
the truth of it. I visited the place<lb/>
and I have seen the pool of water, where<lb/>
happened the miracle I now relate.<lb/>

    
My good old father, then advanced in years,<lb/>
incapable of travel, ordered me<lb/>
to fetch some cattle—thoroughbreds—from there,<lb/>
and had secured a Lycian for my guide,<lb/>

    
as I traversed the pastures, with the man,<lb/>
it chanced, I saw an ancient altar,—grimed<lb/>
with sacrificial ashes—in the midst<lb/>
of a large pool, with sedge and reeds around,<lb/>
a-quiver in the breeze. And there my guide<lb/>
stood on the marge, and with an awe-struck voice<lb/>
began to whisper, “Be propitious, hear<lb/>
my supplications, and forget not me!”<lb/>

    
And I, observing him, echoed the words,<lb/>
“Forget not me!” which, having done, I turned<lb/>
to him and said, “Whose altar can this be?<lb/>
Perhaps a sacred altar of the Fauns,<lb/>
or of the Naiads, or a native God?”<lb/>

    
To which my guide replied, “Young man, such Gods<lb/>
may not be worshiped at this altar. She<lb/>
whom once the royal Juno drove away<lb/>
to wander a harsh world, alone permits<lb/>
this altar to be used: that goddess whom<lb/>
the wandering Isle of Delos, at the time<lb/>
it drifted as the foam, almost refused<lb/>
a refuge.<lb/>

    
There Latona, as she leaned<lb/>
against a palm-tree—and against the tree<lb/>
most sacred to Minerva, brought forth twins,<lb/>
although their harsh step-mother, Juno, strove<lb/>
to interfere.—And from the island forced<lb/>
to fly by jealous Juno, on her breast<lb/>
she bore her children, twin Divinities.<lb/>

    
At last, outwearied with the toil, and parched<lb/>
with thirst—long-wandering in those heated days<lb/>
over the arid land of Lycia, where<lb/>
was bred the dire Chimaera— at the time<lb/>
her parching breasts were drained, she saw this pool<lb/>
of crystal water, shimmering in the vale.<lb/>

    
Some countrymen were there to gather reeds,<lb/>
and useful osiers, and the bulrush, found<lb/>
with sedge in fenny pools. To them approached<lb/>
Latona, and she knelt upon the merge<lb/>
to cool her thirst, with some refreshing water.<lb/>
But those clowns forbade her and the goddess cried,<lb/>
as they so wickedly opposed her need:<lb/>

    
“Why do you so resist my bitter thirst?<lb/>
The use of water is the sacred right<lb/>
of all mankind, for Nature has not made<lb/>
the sun and air and water, for the sole<lb/>
estate of any creature; and to Her<lb/>
kind bounty I appeal, although of you<lb/>
I humbly beg the use of it. Not here<lb/>
do I intend to bathe my wearied limbs.<lb/>
I only wish to quench an urgent thirst,<lb/>
for, even as I speak, my cracking lips<lb/>
and mouth so parched, almost deny me words.<lb/>
A drink of water will be like a draught<lb/>
of nectar, giving life; and I shall owe<lb/>
to you the bounty and my life renewed.—<lb/>
ah, let these tender infants, whose weak arms<lb/>
implore you from my bosom, but incline<lb/>
your hearts to pity!” And just as she spoke,<lb/>
it chanced the children did stretch out their arms<lb/>
and who would not be touched to hear such words,<lb/>
as spoken by this goddess, and refuse?<lb/>

    
But still those clowns persisted in their wrong<lb/>
against the goddess; for they hindered her,<lb/>
and threatened with their foul, abusive tongues<lb/>
to frighten her away—and, worse than all,<lb/>
they even muddied with their hands and feet<lb/>
the clear pool; forcing the vile, slimy dregs<lb/>
up from the bottom, in a spiteful way,<lb/>
by jumping up and down.—Enraged at this,<lb/>
she felt no further thirst, nor would she deign<lb/>
to supplicate again; but, feeling all<lb/>
the outraged majesty of her high state,<lb/>
she raised her hands to Heaven, and exclaimed,<lb/>
“Forever may you live in that mud-pool!”<lb/>

    
The curse as soon as uttered took effect,<lb/>
and every one of them began to swim<lb/>
beneath the water, and to leap and plunge<lb/>
deep in the pool.—Now, up they raise their heads,<lb/>
now swim upon the surface, now they squat<lb/>
themselves around the marshy margent, now<lb/>
they plump again down to the chilly deeps.<lb/>
And, ever and again, with croaking throats,<lb/>
indulge offensive strife upon the banks,<lb/>
or even under water, boom abuse.<lb/>

    
Their ugly voices cause their bloated necks<lb/>
to puff out; and their widened jaws are made<lb/>
still wider in the venting of their spleen.<lb/>

    
Their backs, so closely fastened to their heads,<lb/>
make them appear as if their shrunken necks<lb/>
have been cut off. Their backbones are dark green;<lb/>
white are their bellies, now their largest part.—<lb/>

    
Forever since that time, the foolish frogs<lb/>
muddy their own pools, where they leap and dive.<lb/>


Marsyas. Pelops.
MARSYAS

So he related how the clowns were changed<lb/>
to leaping frogs; and after he was through,<lb/>
another told the tale of Marsyas, in these words:<lb/>

    
The Satyr Marsyas, when he played the flute<lb/>
in rivalry against Apollo's lyre,<lb/>
lost that audacious contest and, alas!<lb/>
His life was forfeit; for, they had agreed<lb/>
the one who lost should be the victor's prey.<lb/>
And, as Apollo punished him, he cried,<lb/>
“Ah-h-h! why are you now tearing me apart?<lb/>
A flute has not the value of my life!”<lb/>

    
Even as he shrieked out in his agony,<lb/>
his living skin was ripped off from his limbs,<lb/>
till his whole body was a flaming wound,<lb/>
with nerves and veins and viscera exposed.<lb/>

    
But all the weeping people of that land,<lb/>
and all the Fauns and Sylvan Deities,<lb/>
and all the Satyrs, and Olympus, his<lb/>
loved pupil—even then renowned in song,<lb/>
and all the Nymphs, lamented his sad fate;<lb/>
and all the shepherds, roaming on the hills,<lb/>
lamented as they tended fleecy flocks.<lb/>

    
And all those falling tears, on fruitful Earth,<lb/>
descended to her deepest veins, as drip<lb/>
the moistening dews,—and, gathering as a fount,<lb/>
turned upward from her secret-winding caves,<lb/>
to issue, sparkling, in the sun-kissed air,<lb/>
the clearest river in the land of Phrygia,—<lb/>
through which it swiftly flows between steep banks<lb/>
down to the sea: and, therefore, from his name,<lb/>
'Tis called “The Marsyas” to this very day.<lb/>

    
And after this was told, the people turned<lb/>
and wept for Niobe's loved children dead,<lb/>
and also, mourned Amphion, sorrow-slain.<lb/>

PELOPS

The Theban people hated Niobe,<lb/>
but Pelops, her own brother, mourned her death;<lb/>
and as he rent his garment, and laid bare<lb/>
his white left shoulder, you could see the part<lb/>
composed of ivory.—At his birth 'twas all<lb/>
of healthy flesh; but when his father cut<lb/>
his limbs asunder, and the Gods restored<lb/>
his life, all parts were rightly joined, except<lb/>
part of one shoulder, which was wanting; so<lb/>
to serve the purpose of the missing flesh,<lb/>
a piece of ivory was inserted there,<lb/>
making his body by such means complete.<lb/>


Procne et Philomela.
TEREUS AND PHILOMELA

The lords of many cities that were near,<lb/>
now met together and implored their kings<lb/>
to mourn with Pelops those unhappy deeds.—<lb/>

    
The lords of Argos; Sparta and Mycenae;<lb/>
and Calydon, before it had incurred<lb/>
the hatred of Diana, goddess of the chase;<lb/>
fertile Orchomenus and Corinth, great<lb/>
in wealth of brass; Patrae and fierce Messena;<lb/>
Cleone, small; and Pylus and Troezen,<lb/>
not ruled by Pittheus then,—and also, all<lb/>
the other cities which are shut off by<lb/>
the Isthmus there dividing by its two seas,<lb/>
and all the cities which are seen from there.<lb/>

    
What seemed most wonderful, of all those towns<lb/>
Athens alone was wanting, for a war<lb/>
had gathered from the distant seas, a host<lb/>
of savage warriors had alarmed her walls,<lb/>
and hindered her from mourning for the dead.<lb/>

    
Now Tereus, then the mighty king of Thrace,<lb/>
came to the aid of Athens as defense<lb/>
from that fierce horde; and there by his great deeds<lb/>
achieved a glorious fame. Since his descent<lb/>
was boasted from the mighty Gradivus,<lb/>
and he was gifted with enormous wealth,<lb/>
Pandion, king of Athens, gave to him<lb/>
in sacred wedlock his dear daughter, Procne.<lb/>

    
But Juno, guardian of the sacred rites<lb/>
attended not, nor Hymenaeus, nor<lb/>
the Graces. But the Furies snatched up brands<lb/>
from burning funeral pyres, and brandished them<lb/>
as torches. They prepared the nuptial couch,—<lb/>
a boding owl flew over the bride's room,<lb/>
and then sat silently upon the roof.<lb/>

    
With such bad omens Tereus married her,<lb/>
sad Procne, and those omens cast a gloom<lb/>
on all the household till the fateful birth<lb/>
of their first born. All Thrace went wild with joy—<lb/>
and even they, rejoicing, blessed the Gods,<lb/>
when he, the little Itys, saw the light;<lb/>
and they ordained each year their wedding day,<lb/>
and every year the birthday of their child,<lb/>
should be observed with festival and song:<lb/>
so the sad veil of fate conceals from us<lb/>
our future woes.<lb/>

    
Now Titan had drawn forth<lb/>
the changing seasons through five autumns, when,<lb/>
in gentle accents, Procne spoke these words:<lb/>
“My dearest husband, if you love me, let<lb/>
me visit my dear sister, or consent<lb/>
that she may come to us and promise her<lb/>
that she may soon return. If you will but<lb/>
permit me to enjoy her company<lb/>
my heart will bless you as I bless the Gods.”<lb/>

    
At once the monarch ordered his long ships<lb/>
to launch upon the sea; and driven by sail,<lb/>
and hastened by the swiftly sweeping oars,<lb/>
they entered the deep port of Athens, where<lb/>
he made fair landing on the fortified<lb/>
Piraeus. There, when time was opportune<lb/>
to greet his father-in-law and shake his hand,<lb/>
they both exchanged their wishes for good health,<lb/>
and Tereus told the reason why he came.<lb/>

    
He was relating all his wife's desire.<lb/>
Promising Philomela's safe return<lb/>
from a brief visit, when Philomela appeared<lb/>
rich in her costly raiment, yet more rich<lb/>
in charm and beauty, just as if a fair<lb/>
Dryad or Naiad should be so attired,<lb/>
appearing radiant, from dark solitudes.<lb/>

    
As if someone should kindle whitening corn<lb/>
or the dry leaves, or hay piled in a stack;<lb/>
so Tereus, when he saw the beautiful<lb/>
and blushing virgin, was consumed with love.<lb/>

    
Her modest beauty was a worthy cause<lb/>
of worthy love; but by his heritage,<lb/>
derived from a debasing clime, his love<lb/>
was base; and fires unholy burned within<lb/>
from his own lawless nature, just as fierce<lb/>
as are the habits of his evil race.<lb/>

    
In the wild frenzy of his wicked heart,<lb/>
he thought he would corrupt her trusted maid,<lb/>
her tried attendants, and corrupt even<lb/>
her virtue with large presents: he would waste<lb/>
his kingdom in the effort.—He prepared<lb/>
to seize her at the risk of cruel war.<lb/>
And he would do or dare all things to feed<lb/>
his raging flame.—He could not brook delay.<lb/>

    
With most impassioned words he begged for her,<lb/>
pretending he gave voice to Procne's hopes.—<lb/>
his own desire made him wax eloquent,<lb/>
as often as his words exceeded bounds,<lb/>
he pleaded he was uttering Procne's words.<lb/>

    
His hypocritic eyes were filled with tears,<lb/>
as though they represented her desire—<lb/>
and, O you Gods above, what devious ways<lb/>
are harbored in the hearts of mortals!  Through<lb/>
his villainous desire he gathered praise,<lb/>
and many lauded him for the great love<lb/>
he bore his wife.<lb/>

    
And even Philomela<lb/>
desires her own undoing; and with fond<lb/>
embraces nestles to her father, while<lb/>
she pleads for his consent, that she may go<lb/>
to visit her dear sister.—Tereus viewed<lb/>
her pretty pleading, and in his hot heart,<lb/>
imagined he was then embracing her;<lb/>
and as he saw her kiss her father's lips,<lb/>
her arms around his neck, it seemed that each<lb/>
caress was his; and so his fire increased.<lb/>
He even wished he were her father; though,<lb/>
if it were so, his passion would no less<lb/>
be impious.—Overcome at last by these<lb/>
entreaties, her kind father gave consent.<lb/>
Greatly she joyed and thanked him for her own<lb/>
misfortune. She imagined a success,<lb/>
instead of all the sorrow that would come.<lb/>

    
The day declining, little of his toil<lb/>
remained for Phoebus. Now his flaming steeds<lb/>
were beating with their hoofs the downward slope<lb/>
of high Olympus; and the regal feast<lb/>
was set before the guests, and flashing wine<lb/>
was poured in golden vessels, and the feast<lb/>
went merrily, until the satisfied<lb/>
assembly sought in gentle sleep their rest.<lb/>

    
Not so, the love-hot Tereus, king of Thrace,<lb/>
who, sleepless, imaged in his doting mind<lb/>
the form of Philomela, recalled the shape<lb/>
of her fair hands, and in his memory<lb/>
reviewed her movements. And his flaming heart<lb/>
pictured her beauties yet unseen.—He fed<lb/>
his frenzy on itself, and could not sleep.<lb/>

    
Fair broke the day; and now the ancient king,<lb/>
Pandion, took his son-in-law's right hand<lb/>
to bid farewell; and, as he wept,<lb/>
commended his dear daughter, Philomela,<lb/>
unto his guarding care. “And in your care,<lb/>
my son-in-law, I trust my daughter's health.<lb/>
Good reason, grounded on my love, compels<lb/>
my sad approval. You have begged for her,<lb/>
and both my daughters have persuaded me.<lb/>
Wherefore, I do entreat you and implore<lb/>
your honor, as I call upon the Gods,<lb/>
that you will ever shield her with the love<lb/>
of a kind father and return her safe,<lb/>
as soon as may be—my last comfort given<lb/>
to bless my doting age. And all delay<lb/>
will agitate and vex my failing heart.<lb/>

    
“And, O my dearest daughter, Philomela,<lb/>
if you have any love for me, return<lb/>
without too long delay and comfort me,<lb/>
lest I may grieve; for it is quite enough<lb/>
that I should suffer while your sister stays away.”<lb/>


    
The old king made them promise, and he kissed<lb/>
his daughter, while he wept. Then did he join<lb/>
their hands in pledge of their fidelity,<lb/>
and, as he gave his blessing, cautioned them<lb/>
to kiss his absent daughter and her son<lb/>
for his dear sake. Then as he spoke a last<lb/>
farewell, his trembling voice was filled with sobs.<lb/>
And he could hardly speak;—for a great fear<lb/>
from some vague intuition of his mind,<lb/>
surged over him, and he was left forlorn.<lb/>

    
So soon as Philomela was safe aboard<lb/>
the painted ship and as the sailors urged<lb/>
the swiftly gliding keel across the deep<lb/>
and the dim land fast-faded from their view,<lb/>
then Tereus, in exultant humor, thought,<lb/>
“Now all is well, the object of my love<lb/>
sails with me while the sailors ply the oars.”,<lb/>

    
He scarcely could control his barbarous<lb/>
desire—with difficulty stayed his lust,<lb/>
he followed all her actions with hot eyes. —<lb/>
So, when the ravenous bird of Jupiter<lb/>
has caught with crooked talons the poor hare,<lb/>
and dropped it—ruthless,—in his lofty nest,<lb/>
where there is no escape, his cruel eyes<lb/>
gloat on the victim he anticipates.<lb/>

    
And now, as Tereus reached his journey's end,<lb/>
they landed from the travel-wearied ship,<lb/>
safe on the shores of his own kingdom. Then<lb/>
he hastened with the frightened Philomela<lb/>
into most wild and silent solitudes<lb/>
of an old forest; where, concealed among<lb/>
deep thickets a forbidding old house stood:<lb/>
there he immured the pale and trembling maid,<lb/>
who, vainly in her fright, began to call<lb/>
upon her absent sister,—and her tears<lb/>
implored his pity. His obdurate mind<lb/>
could not be softened by such piteous cries;<lb/>
but even while her agonizing screams<lb/>
implored her sister's and her father's aid,<lb/>
and while she vainly called upon the Gods,<lb/>
he overmastered her with brutal force.—<lb/>

    
The poor child trembled as a frightened lamb,<lb/>
which, just delivered from the frothing jaws<lb/>
of a gaunt wolf, dreads every moving twig.<lb/>
She trembled as a timid injured dove,<lb/>
(her feathers dripping with her own life-blood)<lb/>
that dreads the ravening talons of a hawk<lb/>
from which some fortune has delivered her.<lb/>

    
But presently, as consciousness returned,<lb/>
she tore her streaming hair and beat her arms,<lb/>
and, stretching forth her hands in frenzied grief,<lb/>
cried out, “Oh, barbarous and brutal wretch!<lb/>
Unnatural monster of abhorrent deeds!<lb/>
Could not my anxious father's parting words,<lb/>
nor his foreboding tears restrain your lust?<lb/>
Have you no slight regard for your chaste wife,<lb/>
my dearest sister, and are you without<lb/>
all honor, so to spoil virginity <lb/>
now making me invade my sister's claim,<lb/>
you have befouled the sacred fount of life,—<lb/>
you are a lawless bond of double sin!<lb/>

    
“Oh, this dark punishment was not my due!<lb/>
Come, finish with my murder your black deed,<lb/>
so nothing wicked may remain undone.<lb/>
But oh, if you had only slaughtered me<lb/>
before your criminal embrace befouled<lb/>
my purity, I should have had a shade<lb/>
entirely pure, and free from any stain!<lb/>
Oh, if there is a Majesty in Heaven,<lb/>
and if my ruin has not wrecked the world,<lb/>
then, you shall suffer for this grievous wrong<lb/>
and time shall hasten to avenge my wreck.<lb/>

    
“I shall declare your sin before the world,<lb/>
and publish my own shame to punish you!<lb/>
And if I'm prisoned in the solitudes,<lb/>
my voice will wake the echoes in the wood<lb/>
and move the conscious rocks. Hear me, O Heaven!<lb/>
And let my imprecations rouse the Gods—<lb/>
ah-h-h, if there can be a god in Heaven!”<lb/>

    
Her cries aroused the dastard tyrant's wrath,<lb/>
and frightened him, lest ever his foul deed<lb/>
might shock his kingdom: and, roused at once<lb/>
by rage and guilty fear; he seized her hair,<lb/>
forced her weak arms against her back, and bound<lb/>
them fast with brazen chains, then drew his sword.<lb/>

    
When she first saw his sword above her head.<lb/>
Flashing and sharp, she wished only for death,<lb/>
and offered her bare throat: but while she screamed,<lb/>
and, struggling, called upon her father's name,<lb/>
he caught her tongue with pincers, pitiless,<lb/>

    
And cut it with his sword.—The mangled root<lb/>
still quivered, but the bleeding tongue itself,<lb/>
fell murmuring on the blood-stained floor. As the tail<lb/>
of a slain snake still writhes upon the ground,<lb/>
so did the throbbing tongue; and, while it died,<lb/>
moved up to her, as if to seek her feet.—<lb/>
And, it is said that after this foul crime,<lb/>
the monster violated her again.<lb/>

    
And after these vile deeds, that wicked king<lb/>
returned to Procne, who, when she first met<lb/>
her brutal husband, anxiously inquired<lb/>
for tidings of her sister; but with sighs<lb/>
and tears, he told a false tale of her death,<lb/>
and with such woe that all believed it true.<lb/>

    
Then Procne, full of lamentation, took<lb/>
her royal robe, bordered with purest gold,<lb/>
and putting it away, assumed instead<lb/>
garments of sable mourning; and she built<lb/>
a noble sepulchre, and offered there<lb/>
her pious gifts to an imagined shade;—<lb/>
lamenting the sad death of her who lived.<lb/>

    
A year had passed by since that awful date—<lb/>
the sun had coursed the Zodiac's twelve signs.<lb/>
But what could Philomela hope or do?<lb/>
For like a jail the strong walls of the house<lb/>
were built of massive stone, and guards around<lb/>
prevented flight; and mutilated, she<lb/>
could not communicate with anyone<lb/>
to tell her injuries and tragic woe.<lb/>

    
But even in despair and utmost grief,<lb/>
there is an ingenuity which gives<lb/>
inventive genius to protect from harm:<lb/>
and now, the grief-distracted Philomela<lb/>
wove in a warp with purple marks and white,<lb/>
a story of the crime; and when 'twas done<lb/>
she gave it to her one attendant there<lb/>
and begged her by appropriate signs to take<lb/>
it secretly to Procne. She took the web,<lb/>
she carried it to Procne, with no thought<lb/>
of words or messages by art conveyed.<lb/>

    
The wife of that inhuman tyrant took<lb/>
the cloth, and after she unwrapped it saw<lb/>
and understood the mournful record sent.<lb/>
She pondered it in silence and her tongue<lb/>
could find no words to utter her despair;—<lb/>
her grief and frenzy were too great for tears.—<lb/>
In a mad rage her rapid mind counfounded<lb/>
the right and wrong—intent upon revenge.<lb/>


    
Since it was now the time of festival,<lb/>
when all the Thracian matrons celebrate<lb/>
the rites of Bacchus—every third year thus—<lb/>
night then was in their secret; and at night<lb/>
the slopes of Rhodope resounded loud<lb/>
with clashing of shrill cymbals. So, at night<lb/>
the frantic queen of Tereus left her home<lb/>
and, clothed according to the well known rites<lb/>
of Bacchus, hurried to the wilderness.<lb/>

    
Her head was covered with the green vine leaves;<lb/>
and from her left side native deer skin hung;<lb/>
and on her shoulder rested a light spear.—<lb/>
so fashioned, the revengeful Procne rushed<lb/>
through the dark woods, attended by a host<lb/>
of screaming followers, and wild with rage,<lb/>
pretended it was Bacchus urged her forth.<lb/>

    
At last she reached the lonely building, where<lb/>
her sister, Philomela, was immured;<lb/>
and as she howled and shouted “Ee-woh-ee-e!”,<lb/>
She forced the massive doors; and having seized<lb/>
her sister, instantly concealed her face<lb/>
in ivy leaves, arrayed her in the trappings<lb/>
of Bacchanalian rites. When this was done,<lb/>
they rushed from there, demented, to the house<lb/>
where as the Queen of Tereus, Procne dwelt.<lb/>

    
When Philomela knew she had arrived<lb/>
at that accursed house, her countenance,<lb/>
though pale with grief, took on a ghastlier hue:<lb/>
and, wretched in her misery and fright,<lb/>
she shuddered in convulsions.—Procne took<lb/>
the symbols, Bacchanalian, from her then,<lb/>
and as she held her in a strict embrace<lb/>
unveiled her downcast head. But she refused<lb/>
to lift her eyes, and fixing her sad gaze<lb/>
on vacant space, she raised her hand, instead;<lb/>
as if in oath she called upon the Gods<lb/>
to witness truly she had done no wrong,<lb/>
but suffered a disgrace of violence.—<lb/>

    
Lo, Procne, wild with a consuming rage,<lb/>
cut short her sister's terror in these words,<lb/>
“This is no time for weeping! awful deeds<lb/>
demand a great revenge—take up the sword,<lb/>
and any weapon fiercer than its edge!<lb/>
My breast is hardened to the worst of crime<lb/>
make haste with me! together let us put<lb/>
this palace to the torch!<lb/>

    
“Come, let us maim,<lb/>
the beastly Tereus with revenging iron,<lb/>
cut out his tongue, and quench his cruel eyes,<lb/>
and hurl and burn him writhing in the flames!<lb/>
Or, shall we pierce him with a grisly blade,<lb/>
and let his black soul issue from deep wounds<lb/>
a thousand.—Slaughter him with every death<lb/>
imagined in the misery of hate!”<lb/>

    
While Procne still was raving out such words,<lb/>
Itys, her son, was hastening to his mother;<lb/>
and when she saw him, her revengeful eyes<lb/>
conceiving a dark punishment, she said,<lb/>
“Aha! here comes the image of his father!”<lb/>
She gave no other warning, but prepared<lb/>
to execute a horrible revenge.<lb/>

    
But when the tender child came up to her,<lb/>
and called her “mother”, put his little arms<lb/>
around her neck, and when he smiled and kissed<lb/>
her often, gracious in his cunning ways,—<lb/>
again the instinct of true motherhood<lb/>
pulsed in her veins, and moved to pity, she<lb/>
began to weep in spite of her resolve.<lb/>

    
Feeling the tender impulse of her love<lb/>
unnerving her, she turned her eyes from him<lb/>
and looked upon her sister, and from her<lb/>
glanced at her darling boy again. And so,<lb/>
while she was looking at them both, by turns,<lb/>
she said, “Why does the little one prevail<lb/>
with pretty words, while Philomela stands<lb/>
in silence always, with her tongue torn out?<lb/>
She cannot call her sister, whom he calls<lb/>
his mother! Oh, you daughter of Pandion,<lb/>
consider what a wretch your husband is!<lb/>
The wife of such a monster must be flint;<lb/>
compassion in her heart is but a crime.”<lb/>

    
No more she hesitated, but as swift<lb/>
as the fierce tigress of the Ganges leaps,<lb/>
seizes the suckling offspring of the hind,<lb/>
and drags it through the forest to its lair;<lb/>
so, Procne seized and dragged the frightened boy<lb/>
to a most lonely section of the house;<lb/>
and there she put him to the cruel sword,<lb/>
while he, aware of his sad fate, stretched forth<lb/>
his little hands, and cried, “Ah, mother,—ah!—”<lb/>
And clung to her—clung to her, while she struck—<lb/>
her fixed eyes, maddened, glaring horribly—<lb/>
struck wildly, lopping off his tender limbs.<lb/>
But Philomela cut through his tender throat.<lb/>

    
Then they together, mangled his remains,<lb/>
still quivering with the remnant of his life,<lb/>
and boiled a part of him in steaming pots,<lb/>
that bubbled over with the dead child's blood,<lb/>
and roasted other parts on hissing spits.<lb/>

    
And, after all was ready, Procne bade<lb/>
her husband, Tereus, to the loathsome feast,<lb/>
and with a false pretense of sacred rites,<lb/>
according to the custom of her land,<lb/>
by which, but one man may partake of it,<lb/>
she sent the servants from the banquet hall.—<lb/>
Tereus, majestic on his ancient throne<lb/>
high in imagined state, devoured his son,<lb/>
and gorged himself with flesh of his own flesh—<lb/>
and in his rage of gluttony called out<lb/>
for Itys to attend and share the feast!<lb/>

    
Curst with a joy she could conceal no more,<lb/>
and eager to gloat over his distress,<lb/>
Procne cried out,<lb/>

    
“Inside yourself, you have<lb/>
the thing that you are asking for!” — Amazed,<lb/>
he looked around and called his son again:—<lb/>

    
that instant, Philomela sprang forth—her hair<lb/>
disordered, and all stained with blood of murder,<lb/>
unable then to speak, she hurled the head<lb/>
of Itys in his father's fear-struck face,<lb/>
and more than ever longed for fitting words.<lb/>

    
The Thracian Tereus overturned the table,<lb/>
and howling, called up from the Stygian pit,<lb/>
the viperous sisters. Tearing at his breast,<lb/>
in miserable efforts to disgorge<lb/>
the half-digested gobbets of his son,<lb/>
he called himself his own child's sepulchre,<lb/>
and wept the hot tears of a frenzied man.<lb/>
Then with his sword he rushed at the two sisters.<lb/>

    
Fleeing from him, they seemed to rise on wings,<lb/>
and it was true, for they had changed to birds.<lb/>
Then Philomela, flitting to the woods,<lb/>
found refuge in the leaves: but Procne flew<lb/>
straight to the sheltering gables of a roof—<lb/>
and always, if you look, you can observe<lb/>
the brand of murder on the swallow's breast—<lb/>
red feathers from that day. And Tereus, swift<lb/>
in his great agitation, and his will<lb/>
to wreak a fierce revenge, himself is turned<lb/>
into a crested bird. His long, sharp beak<lb/>
is given him instead of a long sword,<lb/>
and so, because his beak is long and sharp,<lb/>
he rightly bears the name of Hoopoe.<lb/>


Boreas. Zetes et Calais.

Before the number of his years was told,<lb/>
Pandion with the shades of Tartarus,<lb/>
because of this, has wandered in sad dooms.<lb/>

ORITHYIA AND BOREAS

Erectheus, next in line, with mighty sway<lb/>
and justice, ruled all Athens on the throne<lb/>
left vacant by the good Pandion's death.<lb/>
Four daughters and four sons were granted him;<lb/>
and of his daughters, two were beautiful,<lb/>
and one of these was wed to Cephalus,<lb/>
grandson of Aeolus. — But mighty Boreas<lb/>
desired the hand of Orithyia, fair<lb/>
and lovable.—King Tereus and the Thracians<lb/>
were then such obstacles to Boreas<lb/>
the god was long kept from his dear beloved.<lb/>
Although the great king (who compels the cold<lb/>
north-wind) had sought with prayers to win her hand,<lb/>
and urged his love in gentleness, not force.<lb/>

    
When quite aware his wishes were disdained,<lb/>
he roughly said, with customary rage<lb/>
and violence: “Away with sentimental talk!<lb/>

    
My prayers and kind intentions are despised,<lb/>
but I should blame nobody but myself;<lb/>
then why should I, despising my great strength,<lb/>
debase myself to weakness and soft prayers?—<lb/>
might is my right, and violence my strength!—<lb/>
by force I drive the force of gloomy clouds.<lb/>

    
“Tremendous actions are the wine of life!—<lb/>
monarch of Violence, rolling on clouds,<lb/>
I toss wide waters, and I fell huge trees—<lb/>
knotted old oaks—and whirled upon ice-wings,<lb/>
I scatter the light snow, and pelt the Earth<lb/>
with sleet and hail! I rush through boundless voids.<lb/>
My thunders rumble in the hollow clouds—<lb/>
and crash upon my brothers—fire to fire!<lb/>

    
“Possessed of daemon-rage, I penetrate,<lb/>
sheer to the utmost caverns of old Earth;<lb/>
and straining, up from those unfathomed deeps,<lb/>
scatter the terror-stricken shades of hell;<lb/>
and hurl death-dealing earthquakes through the world!<lb/>

    
“Such are the fateful powers I should use,<lb/>
and never trust entreaties to prevail,<lb/>
or win my bride—Force is the law of life!”<lb/>

    
And now impetuous Boreas, having howled<lb/>
resounding words, unrolled his rustling wings—<lb/>
that fan the earth and ruffle the wide sea—<lb/>
and, swiftly wrapping untrod mountain peaks<lb/>
in whirling mantles of far-woven dust,<lb/>
thence downward hovered to the darkened world;<lb/>
and, canopied in artificial night<lb/>
of swarthy overshadowing wings, caught up<lb/>
the trembling Orithyia to his breast:<lb/>
nor did he hesitate in airy course<lb/>
until his huge wings fanned the chilling winds<lb/>
around Ciconian Walls.<lb/>

    
There, she was pledged<lb/>
the wife of that cold, northern king of storms;<lb/>
and unto him she gave those hero twins,<lb/>
endowed with wings of their immortal sire,<lb/>
and graceful in their mother's form and face.<lb/>

    
Their bird-like wings were not fledged at their birth<lb/>
and those twin boys, Zetes and Calais,<lb/>
at first were void of feathers and soft down.<lb/>
But when their golden hair and beards were grown,<lb/>
wings like an eagle's came;—and feather-down<lb/>
grew golden on their cheeks: and when from youth<lb/>
they entered manhood, quick they were to join<lb/>
the Argonauts, who for the Golden Fleece,<lb/>
sought in that first ship, ventured on the sea.<lb/>

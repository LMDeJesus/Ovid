Nisus et Scylla.
KING MINOS AND SCYLLA

Now Lucifer unveiled the glorious day,<lb/>
and as the session of the night dissolved,<lb/>
the cool east wind declined, and vapors wreathed<lb/>
the moistened valleys. Veering to the south<lb/>
the welcome wind gave passage to the sons<lb/>
of Aeacus, and wafted Cephalus<lb/>
on his returning way, propitious; where<lb/>
before the wonted hour, they entered port.<lb/>

    
King Minos, while the fair wind moved their ship,<lb/>
was laying waste the land of Megara.<lb/>
He gathered a great army round the walls<lb/>
built by Alcathous, where reigned in splendor<lb/>
King Nisus—mighty and renowned in war—<lb/>
upon the center of whose hoary head<lb/>
a lock of purple hair was growing.—Its<lb/>
proved virtue gave protection to his throne.<lb/>

    
Six times the horns of rising Phoebe grew,<lb/>
and still the changing fortune of the war<lb/>
was in suspense; so, Victory day by day<lb/>
between them hovered on uncertain wings.<lb/>

    
Within that city was a regal tower<lb/>
on tuneful walls; where once Apollo laid<lb/>
his golden harp; and in the throbbing stone<lb/>
the sounds remained. And there, in times of peace<lb/>
the daughter of king Nisus loved to mount<lb/>
the walls and strike the sounding stone with pebbles:<lb/>
so, when the war began, she often viewed<lb/>
the dreadful contest from that height;<lb/>
until, so long the hostile camp remained,<lb/>
she had become acquainted with the names,<lb/>
and knew the habits, horses and the arms<lb/>
of many a chief, and could discern the signs<lb/>
of their Cydonean quivers.<lb/>

    
More than all,<lb/>
the features of King Minos were engraved<lb/>
upon the tablets of her mind. And when<lb/>
he wore his helmet, crested with gay plumes,<lb/>
she deemed it glorious; when he held his shield<lb/>
shining with gold, no other seemed so grand;<lb/>
and when he poised to hurl the tough spear home,<lb/>
she praised his skill and strength; and when he bent<lb/>
his curving bow with arrow on the cord,<lb/>
she pictured him as Phoebus taking aim,—<lb/>
but when, arrayed in purple, and upon<lb/>
the back of his white war horse, proudly decked<lb/>
with richly broidered housings, he reined in<lb/>
the nervous steed, and took his helmet off,<lb/>
showing his fearless features, then the maid,<lb/>
daughter of Nisus, could control herself<lb/>
no longer; and a frenzy seized her mind.<lb/>

    
She called the javelin happy which he touched,<lb/>
and blessed were the reins within his hand.<lb/>

    
She had an impulse to direct her steps,<lb/>
a tender virgin, through the hostile ranks,<lb/>
or cast her body from the topmost towers<lb/>
into the Gnossian camp. She had a wild<lb/>
desire to open to the enemy<lb/>
the heavy brass-bound gates, or anything<lb/>
that Minos could desire.<lb/>

    
And as she sat<lb/>
beholding the white tents, she cried, “Alas!<lb/>
Should I rejoice or grieve to see this war?<lb/>
I grieve that Minos is the enemy<lb/>
of her who loves him; but unless the war<lb/>
had brought him, how could he be known to me?<lb/>
But should he take me for a hostage? That<lb/>
might end the war—a pledge of peace, he might<lb/>
keep me for his companion.<lb/>

    
“O, supreme<lb/>
of mankind! she who bore you must have been<lb/>
as beautiful as you are; ample cause<lb/>
for Jove to lose his heart.<lb/>

    
“O, happy hour!<lb/>
If moving upon wings through yielding air,<lb/>
I could alight within the hostile camp<lb/>
in front of Minos, and declare to him<lb/>
my name and passion!<lb/>

    
“Then would I implore<lb/>
what dowry he could wish, and would provide<lb/>
whatever he might ask, except alone<lb/>
the city of my father. Perish all<lb/>
my secret hopes before one act of mine<lb/>
should offer treason to accomplish it.<lb/>
And yet, the kindness of a conqueror<lb/>
has often proved a blessing, manifest<lb/>
to those who were defeated. Certainly<lb/>
the war he carries on is justified<lb/>
by his slain son.<lb/>

    
“He is a mighty king,<lb/>
thrice strengthened in his cause. Undoubtedly<lb/>
we shall be conquered, and, if such a fate<lb/>
awaits our city, why should he by force<lb/>
instead of my consuming love, prevail<lb/>
to open the strong gates? Without delay<lb/>
and dreadful slaughter, it is best for him<lb/>
to conquer and decide this savage war.<lb/>

    
“Ah, Minos, how I fear the bitter fate<lb/>
should any warrior hurl his cruel spear<lb/>
and pierce you by mischance, for surely none<lb/>
can be so hardened to transfix your breast<lb/>
with purpose known.”<lb/>

    
Oh, let her love prevail<lb/>
to open for his army the great gates.<lb/>
Only the thought of it, has filled her soul;<lb/>
she is determined to deliver up<lb/>
her country as a dowry with herself,<lb/>
and so decide the war! But what avails<lb/>
this idle talk.<lb/>

    
“A guard surrounds the gates,<lb/>
my father keeps the keys, and he alone<lb/>
is my obstruction, and the innocent<lb/>
account of my despair. Would to the Gods<lb/>
I had no father! Is not man the God<lb/>
of his own fortune, though his idle prayers<lb/>
avail not to compel his destiny?<lb/>

    
“Another woman crazed with passionate desires,<lb/>
which now inflame me, would not hesitate,<lb/>
but with a fierce abandon would destroy<lb/>
whatever checked her passion. Who is there<lb/>
with love to equal mine? I dare to go<lb/>
through flames and swords; but swords and flames<lb/>
are not now needed, for I only need<lb/>
my royal father's lock of purple hair.<lb/>
More precious than fine gold, it has a power<lb/>
to give my heart all that it may desire.”<lb/>


    
While Scylla said this, night that heals our cares<lb/>
came on, and she grew bolder in the dark.<lb/>
And now it is the late and silent hour<lb/>
when slumber takes possession of the breast.<lb/>
Outwearied with the cares of busy day;<lb/>
then as her father slept, with stealthy tread<lb/>
she entered his abode, and there despoiled,<lb/>
and clipped his fatal lock of purple hair.<lb/>

    
Concealing in her bosom the sad prize<lb/>
of crime degenerate, she at once went forth<lb/>
a gate unguarded, and with shameless haste<lb/>
sped through the hostile army to the tent<lb/>
of Minos, whom, astonished, she addressed:<lb/>

    
“Only my love has led me to this deed.<lb/>
The daughter of King Nisus, I am called<lb/>
the maiden Scylla. Unto you I come<lb/>
and offer up a power that will prevail<lb/>
against my country, and I stipulate<lb/>
no recompense except yourself. Take then<lb/>
this purple hair, a token of my love.—<lb/>
Deem it not lightly as a lock of hair<lb/>
held idly forth to you; it is in truth<lb/>
my father's life.” And as she spoke<lb/>
she held out in her guilty hand the prize,<lb/>
and begged him to accept it with her love.<lb/>

    
Shocked at the thought of such a heinous crime,<lb/>
Minos refused, and said, “O execrable thing!<lb/>
Despised abomination of our time!<lb/>
May all the Gods forever banish you<lb/>
from their wide universe, and may the earth<lb/>
and the deep ocean be denied to you!<lb/>
So great a monster shall not be allowed<lb/>
to desecrate the sacred Isle of Crete,<lb/>
where Jupiter was born.” So Minos spoke.<lb/>

    
Nevertheless he conquered Megara,<lb/>
(so aided by the damsel's wicked deed)<lb/>
and as a just and mighty king imposed<lb/>
his own conditions on the vanquished land.<lb/>

    
He ordered his great fleet to tarry not;<lb/>
the hawsers were let loose, and the long oars<lb/>
quickly propelled his brazen-pointed ships.—<lb/>

    
When Scylla saw them launching forth,<lb/>
observed them sailing on the mighty deep,<lb/>
she called with vain entreaties; but at last,<lb/>
aware the prince ignored her and refused<lb/>
to recompense her wickedness, enraged,<lb/>
and raving, she held up her impious hands,<lb/>
her long hair streaming on the wind, — and said:<lb/>

    
“Oh, wherefore have you flown, and left behind<lb/>
the author of your glory. Oh, wretch! wretch<lb/>
to whom I offered up my native land,<lb/>
and sacrificed my father! Where have you<lb/>
now flown, ungrateful man whose victory<lb/>
is both my crime and virtue? And the gift<lb/>
presented to you, and my passion,<lb/>
have these not moved you? All my love and hope<lb/>
in you alone!<lb/>

    
“Forsaken by my prince,<lb/>
shall I return to my defeated land?<lb/>
If never ruined it would shut its walls<lb/>
against me.—Shall I seek my father's face<lb/>
whom I delivered to all-conquering arms?<lb/>
My fellow-citizens despise my name;<lb/>
my friends and neighbors hate me; I have shut<lb/>
the world against me, only in the hope<lb/>
that Crete would surely welcome me;—and now,<lb/>
he has forbidden me.<lb/>

    
“And is it so<lb/>
I am requited by this thankless wretch!<lb/>
Europa could not be your mother! Spawn<lb/>
of cruel Syrtis! Savage cub of fierce<lb/>
Armenian tigress;—or Charybdis, tossed<lb/>
by the wild South-wind begot you! Can you be<lb/>
the son of Jupiter? Your mother was<lb/>
not ever tricked by the false semblance<lb/>
of a bull. All that story of your birth<lb/>
is false! You are the offspring of a bull<lb/>
as fierce as you are!<lb/>

    
“Let your vengeance fall<lb/>
upon me, O my father Nisus, let<lb/>
the ruined city I betrayed rejoice<lb/>
at my misfortunes—richly merited—<lb/>
destroy me, you whom I have ruined;—I<lb/>
should perish for my crimes! But why should you,<lb/>
who conquered by my crime, abandon me?<lb/>
The treason to my father and my land<lb/>
becomes an act of kindness in your cause.<lb/>

    
“That woman is a worthy mate for you<lb/>
who hid in wood deceived the raging bull,<lb/>
and bore to him the infamy of Crete.<lb/>
I do not wonder that Pasiphae<lb/>
preferred the bull to you, more savage than<lb/>
the wildest beast. Alas, alas for me!<lb/>

    
“Do my complaints reach your unwilling ears?<lb/>
Or do the same winds waft away my words<lb/>
that blow upon your ships, ungrateful man?—<lb/>
Ah, wretched that I am, he takes delight<lb/>
in hastening from me. The deep waves resound<lb/>
as smitten by the oars, his ship departs;<lb/>
and I am lost and even my native land<lb/>
is fading from his sight.<lb/>

    
“Oh heart of flint!<lb/>
you shall not prosper in your cruelty,<lb/>
and you shall not forget my sacrifice;<lb/>
in spite of everything I follow you!<lb/>
I'll grasp the curving stern of your swift ship,<lb/>
and I will follow through unending seas.”<lb/>

    
And as she spoke, she leaped into the waves,<lb/>
and followed the receding ships—for strength<lb/>
from passion came to her. And soon she clung<lb/>
unwelcome, to the sailing Gnossian ship.<lb/>

    
Meanwhile, the Gods had changed her father's form<lb/>
and now he hovered over the salt deep,<lb/>
a hawk with tawny wings. So when he saw<lb/>
his daughter clinging to the hostile ship<lb/>
he would have torn her with his rending beak;—<lb/>
he darted towards her through the yielding air.<lb/>
In terror she let go, but as she fell<lb/>
the light air held her from the ocean spray;<lb/>
her feather-weight supported by the breeze;<lb/>
she spread her wings, and changed into a bird.<lb/>
They called her “Ciris” when she cut the wind,<lb/>
and “Ciris”—cut-the-lock—remains her name.<lb/>


Labyrinthus. Ariadnes corona.
MINOS AND THE MINOTAUR

King Minos, when he reached the land of Crete<lb/>
and left his ships, remembered he had made<lb/>
a vow to Jupiter, and offered up<lb/>
a hundred bulls.—The splendid spoils of war<lb/>
adorned his palace.—<lb/>

    
Now the infamous<lb/>
reproach of Crete had grown, till it exposed<lb/>
the double-natured shame. So, Minos, moved<lb/>
to cover his disgrace, resolved to hide<lb/>
the monster in a prison, and he built<lb/>
with intricate design, by Daedalus<lb/>
contrived, an architect of wonderful<lb/>
ability, and famous. This he planned<lb/>
of mazey wanderings that deceived the eyes,<lb/>
and labyrinthic passages involved. <lb/>
so sports the clear Maeander, in the fields<lb/>
of Phrygia winding doubtful; back and forth<lb/>
it meets itself, until the wandering stream<lb/>
fatigued, impedes its wearied waters' flow;<lb/>
from source to sea, from sea to source involved.<lb/>
So Daedalus contrived innumerous paths,<lb/>
and windings vague, so intricate that he,<lb/>
the architect, hardly could retrace his steps.<lb/>

    
In this the Minotaur was long concealed,<lb/>
and there devoured Athenian victims sent<lb/>
three seasons, nine years each, till Theseus, son<lb/>
of Aegeus, slew him and retraced his way,<lb/>
finding the path by Ariadne's thread.<lb/>

    
Without delay the victor fled from Crete,<lb/>
together with the loving maid, and sailed<lb/>
for Dia Isle of Naxos, where he left<lb/>
the maid forlorn, abandoned. Her, in time,<lb/>
lamenting and deserted, Bacchus found<lb/>
and for his love immortalized her name.<lb/>

    
He set in the dark heavens the bright crown<lb/>
that rested on her brows. Through the soft air<lb/>
it whirled, while all the sparkling jewels changed<lb/>
to flashing fires, assuming in the sky<lb/>
between the Serpent-holder and the Kneeler<lb/>
the well-known shape of Ariadne's Crown.<lb/>


Daedalus et Icarus. Perdix.
DAEDALUS AND ICARUS

But Daedalus abhorred the Isle of Crete—<lb/>
and his long exile on that sea-girt shore,<lb/>
increased the love of his own native place.<lb/>
“Though Minos blocks escape by sea and land.”<lb/>
He said, “The unconfined skies remain<lb/>
though Minos may be lord of all the world<lb/>
his sceptre is not regnant of the air,<lb/>
and by that untried way is our escape.”<lb/>

    
This said, he turned his mind to arts unknown<lb/>
and nature unrevealed. He fashioned quills<lb/>
and feathers in due order — deftly formed<lb/>
from small to large, as any rustic pipe<lb/>
prom straws unequal slants. He bound with thread<lb/>
the middle feathers, and the lower fixed<lb/>
with pliant wax; till so, in gentle curves<lb/>
arranged, he bent them to the shape of birds.<lb/>

    
While he was working, his son Icarus,<lb/>
with smiling countenance and unaware<lb/>
of danger to himself, perchance would chase<lb/>
the feathers, ruffled by the shifting breeze,<lb/>
or soften with his thumb the yellow wax,<lb/>
and by his playfulness retard the work<lb/>
his anxious father planned.<lb/>

    
But when at last<lb/>
the father finished it, he poised himself,<lb/>
and lightly floating in the winnowed air<lb/>
waved his great feathered wings with bird-like ease.<lb/>
And, likewise he had fashioned for his son<lb/>
such wings; before they ventured in the air<lb/>
he said, “My son, I caution you to keep<lb/>
the middle way, for if your pinions dip<lb/>
too low the waters may impede your flight;<lb/>
and if they soar too high the sun may scorch them.<lb/>
Fly midway. Gaze not at the boundless sky,<lb/>
far Ursa Major and Bootes next.<lb/>
Nor on Orion with his flashing brand,<lb/>
but follow my safe guidance.”<lb/>

    
As he spoke<lb/>
he fitted on his son the plumed wings<lb/>
with trembling hands, while down his withered cheeks<lb/>
the tears were falling. Then he gave his son<lb/>
a last kiss, and upon his gliding wings<lb/>
assumed a careful lead solicitous.<lb/>
As when the bird leads forth her tender young,<lb/>
from high-swung nest to try the yielding air;<lb/>
so he prevailed on willing Icarus;<lb/>
encouraged and instructed him in a]l<lb/>
the fatal art; and as he waved his wings<lb/>
looked backward on his son.<lb/>

    
Beneath their flight,<lb/>
the fisherman while casting his long rod,<lb/>
or the tired shepherd leaning on his crook,<lb/>
or the rough plowman as he raised his eyes,<lb/>
astonished might observe them on the wing,<lb/>
and worship them as Gods.<lb/>

    
Upon the left<lb/>
they passed by Samos, Juno's sacred isle;<lb/>
Delos and Paros too, were left behind;<lb/>
and on the right Lebinthus and Calymne,<lb/>
fruitful in honey. Proud of his success,<lb/>
the foolish Icarus forsook his guide,<lb/>
and, bold in vanity, began to soar,<lb/>
rising upon his wings to touch the skies;<lb/>
but as he neared the scorching sun, its heat<lb/>
softened the fragrant wax that held his plumes;<lb/>
and heat increasing melted the soft wax—<lb/>
he waved his naked arms instead of wings,<lb/>
with no more feathers to sustain his flight.<lb/>
And as he called upon his father's name<lb/>
his voice was smothered in the dark blue sea,<lb/>
now called Icarian from the dead boy's name.<lb/>

    
The unlucky father, not a father, called,<lb/>
“Where are you, Icarus?” and “Where are you?<lb/>
In what place shall I seek you, Icarus?”<lb/>
He called again; and then he saw the wings<lb/>
of his dear Icarus, floating on the waves;<lb/>
and he began to rail and curse his art.<lb/>

    
He found the body on an island shore,<lb/>
now called Icaria, and at once prepared<lb/>
to bury the unfortunate remains;<lb/>
but while he labored a pert partridge near,<lb/>
observed him from the covert of an oak,<lb/>
and whistled his unnatural delight.<lb/>

    
Know you the cause? 'Twas then a single bird,<lb/>
the first one of its kind. 'Twas never seen<lb/>
before the sister of Daedalus had brought<lb/>
him Perdix, her dear son, to be his pupil.<lb/>
And as the years went by the gifted youth<lb/>
began to rival his instructor's art.<lb/>

    
He took the jagged backbone of a fish,<lb/>
and with it as a model made a saw,<lb/>
with sharp teeth fashioned from a strip of iron.<lb/>
And he was first to make two arms of iron,<lb/>
smooth hinged upon the center, so that one<lb/>
would make a pivot while the other, turned,<lb/>
described a circle. Wherefore Daedalus<lb/>
enraged and envious, sought to slay the youth<lb/>
and cast him headlong from Minerva's fane,—<lb/>
then spread the rumor of an accident.<lb/>

    
But Pallas, goddess of ingenious men,<lb/>
saving the pupil changed him to a bird,<lb/>
and in the middle of the air he flew<lb/>
on feathered wings; and so his active mind—<lb/>
and vigor of his genius were absorbed<lb/>
into his wings and feet; although the name<lb/>
of Perdix was retained.<lb/>

    
The Partridge hides<lb/>
in shaded places by the leafy trees<lb/>
its nested eggs among the bush's twigs;<lb/>
nor does it seek to rise in lofty flight,<lb/>
for it is mindful of its former fall.<lb/>


Aper Calydonius. Meleager.

Wearied with travel Daedalus arrived<lb/>
at Sicily,—where Cocalus was king;<lb/>
and when the wandering Daedalus implored<lb/>
the monarch's kind protection from his foe,<lb/>
he gathered a great army for his guest,<lb/>
and gained renown from an applauding world.<lb/>


ATALANTA AND MELEAGER

Now after Theseus had destroyed in Crete<lb/>
the dreadful monster, Athens then had ceased<lb/>
to pay her mournful tribute; and with wreaths<lb/>
her people decked the temples of the Gods;<lb/>
and they invoked Minerva, Jupiter,<lb/>
and many other Gods whom they adored,<lb/>
with sacrifice and precious offerings,<lb/>
and jars of Frankincense.<lb/>

    
Quick-flying Fame<lb/>
had spread reports of Theseus through the land;<lb/>
and all the peoples of Achaia, from that day,<lb/>
when danger threatened would entreat his aid.<lb/>
So it befell, the land of Calydon,<lb/>
through Meleager and her native hero,<lb/>
implored the valiant Theseus to destroy<lb/>
a raging boar, the ravage of her realm.<lb/>

    
Diana in her wrath had sent the boar<lb/>
to wreak her vengeance; and they say the cause<lb/>
was this:—The nation had a fruitful year,<lb/>
for which the good king Oeneus had decreed<lb/>
that all should offer the first fruits of corn<lb/>
to Ceres—and to Bacchus wine of grapes—<lb/>
and oil of olives to the golden haired<lb/>
Minerva. Thus, the Gods were all adored,<lb/>
beginning with the lowest to the highest,<lb/>
except alone Diana, and of all the Gods<lb/>
her altars only were neglected. No<lb/>
frankincense unto her was given! Neglect<lb/>
enrages even Deities.<lb/>

    
“Am I<lb/>
to suffer this indignity?” she cried,<lb/>
“Though I am thus dishonored, I will not<lb/>
be unrevenged!” And so the boar was sent<lb/>
to ravage the fair land of Calydon.<lb/>

    
And this avenging boar was quite as large<lb/>
as bulls now feeding on the green Epirus,<lb/>
and larger than the bulls of Sicily.<lb/>
A dreadful boar.—His burning, bloodshot eyes<lb/>
seemed coals of living fire, and his rough neck<lb/>
was knotted with stiff muscles, and thick-set<lb/>
with bristles like sharp spikes. A seething froth<lb/>
dripped on his shoulders, and his tusks<lb/>
were like the spoils of Ind. Discordant roars<lb/>
reverberated from his hideous jaws;<lb/>
and lightning—belched forth from his horrid throat—<lb/>
scorched the green fields. He trampled the green corn<lb/>
and doomed the farmer to lament his crops,<lb/>
in vain the threshing-floor has been prepared,<lb/>
in vain the barns await the promised yield.<lb/>
Long branches of the vine and heavy grapes<lb/>
are scattered in confusion, and the fruits<lb/>
and branches of the olive tree, whose leaves<lb/>
should never wither, are cast on the ground.<lb/>

    
His spleen was vented on the simple flocks,<lb/>
which neither dogs nor shepherd could protect;<lb/>
and the brave bulls could not defend their herds.<lb/>
The people fled in all directions from the fields,<lb/>
for safety to the cities. Terror reigned.<lb/>
There seemed no remedy to save the land,<lb/>
till Meleager chose a band of youths,<lb/>
united for the glory of great deeds.<lb/>

    
What heroes shall immortal song proclaim?<lb/>
Castor and Pollux, twins of Tyndarus;<lb/>
one famous for his skill in horsemanship,<lb/>
the other for his boxing. Jason, too, was there,<lb/>
the glorious builder of the world's first ship,<lb/>
and Theseus with his friend Perithous,<lb/>
and Toxeus and Plexippus, fated sons<lb/>
of Thestius, and the son of Aphareus,<lb/>
Lynkeus with his fleet-foot brother Idas<lb/>
and Caeneus, first a woman then a man<lb/>
the brave Leucippus and the argonaut<lb/>
Acastus, swift of dart; and warlike Dryas,<lb/>
Hippothous and Phoenix, not then blind,<lb/>
the son of King Amyntor, and the twain<lb/>
who sprung from Actor, Phyleus thither brought<lb/>
from Elis; Telamon was one of them<lb/>
and even Peleus, father of the great<lb/>
Achilles; and the son of Pheres joined,<lb/>
and Iolas, the swift Eurytion,<lb/>
Echion fleet of foot, Narycian Lelex—<lb/>
and Panopeus, and Hyleus and Hippasus,<lb/>
and Nestor (youthful then), and the four sons<lb/>
Hippocoon from eld Amyclae sent,<lb/>
the father-in-law of queen Penelope,<lb/>
Ancaeus of Arcadia, and the wise<lb/>
soothsayer Mopsus, and the prophet, son<lb/>
of Oeclus, victim of a traitor-wife.—<lb/>

    
And Atalanta, virgin of the groves,<lb/>
of Mount Lycaeus, glory of her sex;<lb/>
a polished buckle fastened her attire;<lb/>
her lustrous hair was fashioned in a knot;<lb/>
her weapons rattled in an ivory case,<lb/>
swung from her white left shoulder, and she held<lb/>
a bow in her left hand. Her face appeared<lb/>
as maidenly for boy, or boyish for girl.<lb/>

    
When Meleager saw her, he at once<lb/>
longed for her beauty, though some god forbade.<lb/>
The fires of love flamed in him; and he said,<lb/>
“Happy the husband who shall win this girl!”<lb/>
Neither the time nor his own modesty<lb/>
permitted him to say another word.<lb/>
But now the dreadful contest with the boar<lb/>
engaged this hero's energy and thought.<lb/>

    
A wood, umbrageous, not impaired with age,<lb/>
slopes from a plain and shadows the wide fields,<lb/>
and there this band of valiant heroes went—<lb/>
eager to slay the dreaded enemy,<lb/>
some spread the nets and some let loose the dogs,<lb/>
some traced the wide spoor of the monster's hoofs.<lb/>

    
There is a deep gorge where the rivulets<lb/>
that gather from the rain, discharge themselves;<lb/>
and there the bending willow, the smooth sedge,<lb/>
the marsh-rush, ozier and tall tangled reed<lb/>
in wild profusion cover up the marsh.<lb/>
Aroused from this retreat the startled boar,<lb/>
as quick as lightning from the clashing clouds<lb/>
crashed all the trees that cumbered his mad way.—<lb/>

    
The young men raised a shout, leveled their spears,<lb/>
and brandished their keen weapons; but the boar<lb/>
rushed onward through the yelping dogs,<lb/>
and scattered them with deadly sidelong stroke.<lb/>

    
Echion was the first to hurl his spear,<lb/>
but slanting in its course it only glanced<lb/>
a nearby maple tree, and next the spear<lb/>
of long-remembered Jason cut the air;<lb/>
so swiftly hurled it seemed it might transfix<lb/>
the boar's back, but with over-force it sped<lb/>
beyond the monster. Poising first his dart,<lb/>
the son of Ampyx, as he cast it, he<lb/>
implored Apollo, “Grant my prayer if I<lb/>
have truly worshiped you, harken to me<lb/>
as always I adore you! Let my spear<lb/>
unerring strike its aim.” Apollo heard,<lb/>
and guided the swift spear, but as it sped<lb/>
Diana struck the iron head from the shaft,<lb/>
and the blunt wood fell harmless from his hide.<lb/>

    
Then was the monster's savage anger roused;<lb/>
as the bright lightning's flash his red eyes flamed;<lb/>
his breath was hot as fire. As when a stone<lb/>
is aimed at walls or strong towers, which protect<lb/>
encompassed armies,—launched by the taut rope<lb/>
it strikes with dreaded impact; so the boar<lb/>
with fatal onset rushed among this band<lb/>
of noble lads, and stretched upon the ground<lb/>
Eupalamon and Pelagon whose guard<lb/>
was on the right; and their companions bore<lb/>
their bodies from the field.<lb/>

    
Another youth,<lb/>
the brave son of Hippocoon received<lb/>
a deadly wound—while turning to escape,<lb/>
the sinew of his thigh was cut and failed<lb/>
to bear his tottering steps.—
And Nestor might<lb/>
have perished then, so long before he fought<lb/>
the heroes of old Troy, but ever wise,<lb/>
he vaulted on his long lance from the ground<lb/>
into the branches of a sheltering tree;<lb/>
where in a safe position, he could look<lb/>
down on his baffled foe. The raging boar<lb/>
whetted his gleaming tushes on an oak.<lb/>

    
Then with his sharpened tusks he gored the thigh<lb/>
of mighty Hippasus. Observed of all,<lb/>
and mounted on their horses—whiter than<lb/>
the northern snow—the twins (long afterward<lb/>
transformed to constellations) sallied forth,<lb/>
and brandishing their lances, poised in air,<lb/>
determined to destroy the bristling boar.<lb/>
It thwarted their design by hiding in<lb/>
a thicket intricate; where neither steed<lb/>
nor lance could penetrate. But Telamon<lb/>
pursued undaunted, and in haste tripped up<lb/>
by tangled roots, fell headlong.—Peleus stooped<lb/>
to rescue him.<lb/>

    
While he regained his feet,<lb/>
the virgin, Atalanta, took her bow<lb/>
and fitting a sharp arrow to the notch,<lb/>
twanged the tight cord. The feathered shaft<lb/>
quivered beneath the monster's ear, the red blood<lb/>
stained his hard bristles.<lb/>

    
Flushed with her success<lb/>
rejoiced the maid, but not more gladly than<lb/>
the hero Meleager. He it was<lb/>
who first observed the blood, and pointed out<lb/>
the stain to his companions as he cried,<lb/>
“Give honor to the courage of a maid!”<lb/>
Unwilling to be worsted by a maid,<lb/>
the rushing heroes raised a mighty cry<lb/>
and as they shouted in excitement, hurled<lb/>
their weapons in confusion; and so great<lb/>
the multitude their actions interfered.<lb/>

    
Behold! Ancaeus wielding his war-axe,<lb/>
and rushing madly to his fate, exclaimed,<lb/>
“Witness it! See the weapons of a man<lb/>
excel a woman's! Ho, make way for my<lb/>
achievement! Let Diana shield the brute!<lb/>
Despite her utmost effort my right hand<lb/>
shall slaughter him!” So mighty in his boast<lb/>
he puffed himself; and, lifting with both hands<lb/>
his double-edged axe, he stood erect,<lb/>
on tiptoe fiercely bold. The savage boar<lb/>
caught him, and ripped his tushes through his groin,<lb/>
a spot where death is sure.—Ancaeus fell;<lb/>
and his torn entrails and his crimson blood<lb/>
stained the fair verdure of the spot with death.<lb/>

    
Ixion's doughty son was running straight<lb/>
against the monster, shaking his long lance<lb/>
with nervous vigor in his strong right hand;<lb/>
but Theseus, standing at a distance called:<lb/>
“Beware! beware, O, dearest of my friends;<lb/>
be valiant at a distance, or the fate<lb/>
of rashly-bold Ancaeus may be yours!”<lb/>

    
Even as he spoke he balanced in his hand<lb/>
his brazen-pointed lance of corner wood;<lb/>
with aim so true it seemed the great boar's death<lb/>
was certain, but an evergreen oak branch<lb/>
shielded the beast.—Then Jason hurled his dart,<lb/>
which turned by chance, transfixed a luckless dog<lb/>
and pinned him yelping, to the sanguine earth.—<lb/>

    
So fared those heroes. Better fortune gave<lb/>
success to Meleager; first he threw<lb/>
a spear that missed and quivered in the ground;<lb/>
but next he hurled a spear with certain aim.<lb/>
It pierced the middle of the monster's back;<lb/>
and rushing in upon the dreaded beast,<lb/>
while raging it was whirling round and round,<lb/>
the fearless prince provoked to greater rage<lb/>
the wounded adversary. Bloody froth<lb/>
dripped down his champing jaws—his purple blood<lb/>
poured from a rankling wound. Without delay<lb/>
the mighty Meleager plunged a spear<lb/>
deep in the monster's shoulder. All his friends<lb/>
raised a glad shout, and gathering round him, tried<lb/>
to grasp his hand.—With wonder they beheld<lb/>
the monster's bulk stretched out upon the plain;<lb/>
and fearful still to touch him, they began<lb/>
to stain their weapons in his spouting blood.<lb/>

    
At length the hero Meleager pressed<lb/>
his conquering foot upon the monster's head<lb/>
and said, “O Atalanta, glorious maid,<lb/>
of Nonacris, to you is yielded spoil,<lb/>
my lawful right, and I rejoice to share<lb/>
the merit of this glorious victory.”<lb/>

    
And while he spoke, he gave to her the pelt,<lb/>
covered with horrid bristles, and the head<lb/>
frightful with gory tusks: and she rejoiced<lb/>
in Meleager and his royal gift.<lb/>

    
But all the others, envious, began<lb/>
to murmur; and the sons of Thestius<lb/>
levelled their pointed spears, and shouted out;<lb/>
“Give up the prize! Let not the confidence<lb/>
of your great beauty be a snare to you!<lb/>
A woman should not interfering filch<lb/>
the manly honors of a mighty hunt!<lb/>
Aside! and let your witless lover yield!”<lb/>
So threatened they and took from her the prize;<lb/>
and forcibly despoiled him of his rights.<lb/>

    
The warlike prince, indignant and enraged,—<lb/>
rowed with resentment, shouted out. “What! Ho!<lb/>
You spoilers of this honor that is ours,<lb/>
brave deeds are different far from craven threats!”<lb/>
And with his cruel sword he pierced the breast<lb/>
of rash Plexippus, taken unawares,<lb/>
and while his brother, Toxeus, struck with fear,<lb/>
stood hesitating whether to avenge<lb/>
or run to safety, Meleager plunged<lb/>
the hot sword, smoking with a brother's blood,<lb/>
in his breast also. And so perished they.<lb/>

ALTHAEA AND THE DEATH OF MELEAGER

Ere this, Althaea, mother of the prince,<lb/>
and sister of the slaughtered twain,—because<lb/>
her son had killed the boar, made haste to bear<lb/>
rich offerings to the temples of the Gods;<lb/>
but when she saw her slaughtered brothers borne<lb/>
in sad procession, she began to shriek,<lb/>
and filled the city with her wild lament.<lb/>
Unwilling to abide her festal robes<lb/>
she dressed in sable.—When she was informed<lb/>
her own son Meleager was the cause,<lb/>
she banished grief and lamentations,—<lb/>
thirsting for vengeance.<lb/>


    
She remembered well,<lb/>
how, when she lay in childbirth round her stood<lb/>
the three attendant sisters of his fate.<lb/>
There was a billet in the room, and this<lb/>
they took and cast upon the wasting flames,<lb/>
and as they spun and drew the fatal threads<lb/>
they softly chanted, “Unto you we give,<lb/>
O child new-born! only the life of this;<lb/>
the period of this billet is your life.”<lb/>
And having spoken so, they vanished in the smoke.<lb/>

    
Althaea snatched the billet from the fire,<lb/>
and having quenched it with drawn water, hid<lb/>
it long and secretly in her own room,<lb/>
where, thus preserved, it acted as a charm<lb/>
to save the life of Meleager. This<lb/>
the mother now brought forth, and fetched a pile<lb/>
of seasoned tinder ready for the torch.<lb/>
She lit the torches and the ready pile,<lb/>
and as the flames leaped up, four times prepared<lb/>
to cast the fatal billet in the midst;<lb/>
and four times hesitated to commit<lb/>
the dreadful deed,—so long the contest veered<lb/>
between the feelings of a mother's breast<lb/>
and the fierce vengeance of a sister's rage.<lb/>

    
Now is the mother's visage pale with fear,<lb/>
and now the sister's sanguinary rage<lb/>
glows in her eyes. Her countenance contorts<lb/>
with cruel threats and in bewildered ways<lb/>
dissolves compassionate: And even when<lb/>
the heat of anger had dried up her eyes<lb/>
the conflict of her passion brought new tears.<lb/>

    
As when the wind has seized upon a ship<lb/>
and blows against a tide of equal force,<lb/>
the vexed vessel feels repellent powers,<lb/>
and with unsteady motion sways to both;<lb/>
so did Althaea hesitate between<lb/>
the conflict of her passions: when her rage<lb/>
had cooled, her fury was as fast renewed:<lb/>
but always the unsatisfied desire<lb/>
of blood, to ease the disembodied shades<lb/>
of her slain brothers, seemed to overcome<lb/>
the mother-instinct; and intensity<lb/>
of conduct proved the utmost test of love.<lb/>

    
She took the billet in her arms and stood<lb/>
before the leaping flames, and said, “Alas,<lb/>
be this the funeral pyre of my own flesh!”<lb/>
And as she held in her relentless hand<lb/>
the destiny of him she loved, and stood<lb/>
before the flames, in all her wretchedness<lb/>
she moaned, “You sad Eumenides attend!<lb/>
Relentless Gods of punishment,—turn, turn<lb/>
your dreadful vision on these baneful rites!<lb/>
I am avenging and committing crime!<lb/>
With death must death be justified and crime<lb/>
be added unto crime! Let funerals<lb/>
upon succeeding funerals attend!<lb/>

    
“Let these accumulating woes destroy<lb/>
a wicked race. Shall happy Oeneus bask<lb/>
in the great fame of his victorious son,<lb/>
and Thestius mourn without slaughtered ones?<lb/>
'Tis better they should both lament the deed!<lb/>
Witness the act of my affection, shades<lb/>
of my departed brothers! and accept<lb/>
my funeral offering, given at a cost<lb/>
beyond my strength to bear. Ah wretched me!<lb/>
Distracted is my reason! Pity me,<lb/>
the yearnings of a stricken mother's heart<lb/>
withholding me from duty! Aye, although<lb/>
his punishment be just, my hands refuse<lb/>
the office of such vengeance. What, shall he<lb/>
alive, victorious, flushed with his success,<lb/>
inherit the broad realms of Calydon,<lb/>
and you, my slaughtered brothers, unavenged,<lb/>
dissolved in ashes, float upon the air,<lb/>
unpalpitating phantoms? How can I<lb/>
endure the thought of it? Oh let the wretch<lb/>
forever perish, and with him be lost<lb/>
the hopes of his sad father, in the wreck<lb/>
of his distracted kingdom. Where are now<lb/>
the love and feelings of a mother; how<lb/>
can I forget the bitter pangs endured<lb/>
while twice times five the slow moon waxed and waned?<lb/>

    
“O had you perished in your infancy<lb/>
by those first fires, and I had suffered it!<lb/>
Your life was in my power! and now your death<lb/>
is the result of wrongs which you have done—<lb/>
take now a just reward for what you did:<lb/>
return to me the life I gave and saved.<lb/>
When from the flames I snatched the fatal brand.<lb/>
Return that gift or take my wretched life,<lb/>
that I may hasten to my brothers' tomb.<lb/>

    
“What dreadful deed can satisfy the law,<lb/>
when I for love against my love am forced?<lb/>
For even as my brothers' wounds appear<lb/>
in visions dreadful to denounce my son,<lb/>
the love so nurtured in a mother's breast<lb/>
breaks down the resolution! Wretched me!<lb/>
Such vengeance for my brothers overcomes<lb/>
first at your birth I gave it, and again<lb/>
the yearning of a mother for her son!<lb/>
Let not my love denounce my vengeance!<lb/>
My soul may follow with its love the shade<lb/>
of him I sacrifice, and following him<lb/>
my shade and his and yours unite below.”<lb/>

    
She spoke and as she turned her face away,<lb/>
she threw the fatal billet on the fire,<lb/>
and as the flames devoured it, a strange groan<lb/>
was heard to issue from the burning wood<lb/>

    
but Meleager at a distance knows<lb/>
of naught to wreck his hour of victory,<lb/>
until he feels the flame of burning wood<lb/>
scorching with secret fire his forfeit life.<lb/>
Yet with a mighty will, disdaining pain<lb/>
he grieves his bloodless and ignoble death.<lb/>
He calls Ancaeus happy for the wounds<lb/>
that caused his death. With sighs and groans he called<lb/>
his aged father's name, and then the names<lb/>
of brothers, sisters, and his wife—and last,<lb/>
they say he called upon his mother's name.<lb/>

    
His torment always with the fire increased,<lb/>
until, as little of the wood remained,—<lb/>
his pain diminished with the heat's decrease;<lb/>
and as the flames extinguished, so his life<lb/>
slowly ascended in the rising air.<lb/>

    
And all the mighty realm of Calydon<lb/>
was filled with lamentations —young and old<lb/>
the common people and the nobles mourned;<lb/>
and all the wailing women tore their hair<lb/>
his father threw his body on the ground,<lb/>
and as he covered his white hair and face<lb/>
with ashy dust, bewailed his aged days.<lb/>

    
Althaea, maddened in her mother's grief,<lb/>
has punished herself with a ruthless hand;<lb/>
she pierced her heart with iron. —Oh! if some God<lb/>
had given a resounding harp, a voice<lb/>
an hundred-fold more mighty, and a soul<lb/>
enlarged with genius, I could never tell<lb/>
the grief of his unhappy sisters.—They,<lb/>
regardless of all shame, beat on their breasts;<lb/>
before the body was consumed with fire,<lb/>
embraced it, and again embracing it,<lb/>
rained kisses on their loved one and the bier.<lb/>
And when the flames had burnt his shrinking form<lb/>
they strained his gathered ashes to their breasts,<lb/>
and prostrate on the tomb kissed his dear name,<lb/>
cut only in the stone,—and bathed it with their tears<lb/>

    
Latona's daughter, glutted with the woes<lb/>
inflicted on Parthaon's house, now gave<lb/>
two of the weeping sisters wide-spread wings,<lb/>
but Gorge and the spouse of Hercules<lb/>
not so were changed. Latona stretched long wings<lb/>
upon their arms, transformed their mouths to beaks,<lb/>
and sent them winging through the lucent air.<lb/>


Theseus apud Acheloum. Perimele.
PERIMELA AND ACHELOUS

And Theseus, meantime, having done great deeds,<lb/>
was wending towards Tritonian Athen's towers,<lb/>
but Achelous, swollen with great rains,<lb/>
opposed his journey and delayed his steps.<lb/>

    
“O famous son of Athens, come to me,<lb/>
beneath my roof, and leave my rapid floods;<lb/>
for they are wont to bear enormous beams,<lb/>
and hurl up heavy stones to bar the way,—<lb/>
mighty with roaring, down the steep ravines.<lb/>
And I have seen the sheep-folds on my banks<lb/>
swept down the flood, together with the sheep;<lb/>
and in the current neither strength availed<lb/>
the ox for safety, nor swift speed the horse.<lb/>
When rushed the melting snows from mountain peaks<lb/>
how many bodies of unwary men<lb/>
this flood has overwhelmed in whirling waves!<lb/>
Rest safely then, until my river runs<lb/>
within its usual bounds—till it contains<lb/>
its flowing waters in its proper banks.”<lb/>

    
and gladly answered Theseus, “I will make<lb/>
good use of both your dwelling and advice.”<lb/>
And waiting not he entered a rude hut,<lb/>
of porous pumice and of rough stone built.<lb/>
The floor was damp and soft with springy moss,<lb/>
and rows of shells and murex arched the roof.<lb/>

    
And now Hyperion having measured quite<lb/>
two thirds of daylight, Theseus and his friends<lb/>
reclined upon the couches.—On his right<lb/>
Ixion's son was placed, and on his left<lb/>
the gray-haired hero Lelex; and others<lb/>
deemed worthy by the Acarnanian-god<lb/>
who was so joyful in his noble guests.<lb/>
Without delay the barefoot nimble Nymphs<lb/>
attending to the banquet, rich food brought;<lb/>
and after all were satisfied with meat<lb/>
and dainties delicate, the careful Nymphs<lb/>
removed all traces of the feast, and served<lb/>
delicious wine in bowls embossed with gems.<lb/>

    
And after they had eaten, Theseus arose,<lb/>
and as he pointed with his finger, said,<lb/>
“Declare to me what name that island bears,<lb/>
or is it one or more than one I see?”<lb/>
To which the ready River-God replied:<lb/>

    
“It is not one we see but five are there,<lb/>
deceptive in the distance. And that you<lb/>
may wonder less at what Diana did,<lb/>
those islands were five Naiads.—Long ago,<lb/>
ten bullocks for a sacrifice they slew;<lb/>
and when the joyous festival was given,<lb/>
ignoring me they bade all other Gods.<lb/>
Indignant at the slight, I swelled with rage<lb/>
as great as ever when my banks are full,—<lb/>
and so redoubled both in rage and flood,<lb/>
I ravished woods from woods, and fields from fields,<lb/>
and hurled into the sea the very soil,<lb/>
together with the Nymphs, who then at last<lb/>
remembered their neglect. And soon my waves,<lb/>
united with the ocean streams, cut through<lb/>
the solid soil, and fashioned from the one,<lb/>
five islands you may see amid the waves,<lb/>
which men since then, have called Echinades.<lb/>

    
“But yet beyond you can observe how one<lb/>
most beautiful of all is far withdrawn;<lb/>
and this which most delights me, mariners<lb/>
have Perimela named. She was so fair<lb/>
that I deprived her of a precious wealth.<lb/>
And when Hippodamas, her father, knew,<lb/>
enraged he pushed her, heavy then with child,<lb/>
forth from a rock into the cruel sea,<lb/>
where she must perish,—but I rescued her;<lb/>
and as I bore her on my swimming tide,<lb/>
I called on Neptune, ruler of the deep,<lb/>
‘O Trident-wielder, you who are preferred<lb/>
next to the god most mighty! who by lot<lb/>
obtained the empire of the flowing deep,<lb/>
to which all sacred rivers flow and end;<lb/>
come here, O Neptune, and with gracious will<lb/>
grant my desire;—I injured her I save;—<lb/>
but if Hippodamas, her father, when<lb/>
he knew my love, had been both kind and just,<lb/>
if he had not been so unnatural,<lb/>
he would have pitied and forgiven her.<lb/>
Ah, Neptune, I beseech you, grant your power<lb/>
may find a place of safety for this Nymph,<lb/>
abandoned to the deep waves by her sire.<lb/>
Or if that cannot be, let her whom I<lb/>
embrace to show my love, let her become<lb/>
a place of safety.’ Instantly to me<lb/>
the King of Ocean moved his mighty head,<lb/>
and all the deep waves quivered in response.<lb/>

    
“The Nymph, afraid, still struggled in the deep,<lb/>
and as she swam I touched her throbbing breast;<lb/>
and as I felt her bosom, trembling still,<lb/>
I thought her soft flesh was becoming hard;<lb/>
for even then, new earth enclosed her form;<lb/>
and as I prayed to Neptune, earth encased<lb/>
her floating limbs;—and on her changing form<lb/>
the heavy soil of that fair island grew.”<lb/>


Philemon et Baucis.
BAUCIS AND PHILEMON

And at this point, the River said no more.<lb/>
This wonderful event astonished all;<lb/>
but one was there, Ixion's haughty son—<lb/>
a known despiser of the living Gods—<lb/>
who, laughing, scorned it as an idle tale.<lb/>
He made a jest of those who heard, and said,<lb/>

    
“A foolish fiction! Achelous, how<lb/>
can such a tale be true? Do you believe<lb/>
a god there is, in heaven so powerful,<lb/>
a god to give and take away a form—<lb/>
transform created shapes?<lb/>

    
Such impious words<lb/>
found no response in those who heard him speak.<lb/>
Amazed he could so doubt known truth, before<lb/>
them all, uprose to vindicate the Gods<lb/>
the hero Lelex, wise in length of days.<lb/>
“The glory of the living Gods,” he said,<lb/>
“Is not diminished, nor their power confined,<lb/>
and whatsoever they decree is done.<lb/>

    
“And I have this to tell, for all must know<lb/>
the evil of such words:—Upon the hills<lb/>
of Phrygia I have seen two sacred trees,<lb/>
a lime-tree and an oak, so closely grown<lb/>
their branches interlace. A low stone wall<lb/>
is built around to guard them from all harm.<lb/>
And that you may not doubt it, I declare<lb/>
again, I saw the spot, for Pittheus there<lb/>
had sent me to attend his father's court.<lb/>

    
“Near by those trees are stagnant pools and fens,<lb/>
where coots and cormorants delight to haunt;<lb/>
but it was not so always. Long ago<lb/>
'Twas visited by mighty Jupiter,<lb/>
together with his nimble-witted son,<lb/>
who first had laid aside his rod and Wings.<lb/>

    
“As weary travelers over all the land<lb/>
they wandered, begging for their food and bed;<lb/>
and of a thousand houses, all the doors<lb/>
were bolted and no word of kindness given—<lb/>
so wicked were the people of that land.<lb/>
At last, by chance, they stopped at a small house,<lb/>
whose humble roof was thatched with reeds and straw;—<lb/>
and here a kind old couple greeted them.<lb/>

    
“The good dame, Baucis, seemed about the age<lb/>
of old Philemon, her devoted man;<lb/>
they had been married in their early youth,<lb/>
in that same cottage and had lived in it,<lb/>
and grown together to a good old age;<lb/>
contented with their lot because they knew<lb/>
their poverty, and felt no shame of it;<lb/>
they had no need of servants; the good pair<lb/>
were masters of their home and served themselves;<lb/>
their own commands they easily obeyed.<lb/>

    
“Now when the two Gods, Jove and Mercury,<lb/>
had reached this cottage, and with bending necks<lb/>
had entered the low door, the old man bade<lb/>
them rest their wearied limbs, and set a bench,<lb/>
on which his good wife, Baucis, threw a cloth;<lb/>
and then with kindly bustle she stirred up<lb/>
the glowing embers on the hearth, and then<lb/>
laid tinder, leaves and bark; and bending down<lb/>
breathed on them with her ancient breath until<lb/>
they kindled into flame. Then from the house<lb/>
she brought a store of faggots and small twigs,<lb/>
and broken branches, and above them swung<lb/>
a kettle, not too large for simple folk.<lb/>
And all this done, she stripped some cabbage leaves,<lb/>
which her good husband gathered for the meal.<lb/>

    
“Then with a two-pronged fork the man let down<lb/>
a rusty side of bacon from aloft,<lb/>
and cut a little portion from the chine;<lb/>
which had been cherished long. He softened it<lb/>
in boiling water. All the while they tried<lb/>
with cheerful conversation to beguile,<lb/>
so none might notice a brief loss of time.<lb/>

    
“Swung on a peg they had a beechwood trough,<lb/>
which quickly with warm water filled, was used<lb/>
for comfortable washing. And they fixed,<lb/>
upon a willow couch, a cushion soft<lb/>
of springy sedge, on which they neatly spread<lb/>
a well worn cloth preserved so many years;<lb/>
'Twas only used on rare and festive days;<lb/>
and even it was coarse and very old,<lb/>
though not unfit to match a willow couch!<lb/>

    
“Now as the Gods reclined, the good old dame,<lb/>
whose skirts were tucked up, moving carefully,<lb/>
for so she tottered with her many years,<lb/>
fetched a clean table for the ready meal—<lb/>
but one leg of the table was too short,<lb/>
and so she wedged it with a potsherd—so<lb/>
made firm, she cleanly scoured it with fresh mint.<lb/>

    
“And here is set the double-tinted fruit<lb/>
of chaste Minerva, and the tasty dish<lb/>
of corner, autumn-picked and pickled; these<lb/>
were served for relish; and the endive-green,<lb/>
and radishes surrounding a large pot<lb/>
of curdled milk; and eggs not overdone<lb/>
but gently turned in glowing embers—all<lb/>
served up in earthen dishes. Then sweet wine<lb/>
served up in clay, so costly! all embossed,<lb/>
and cups of beechwood smoothed with yellow wax.<lb/>

    
“So now they had short respite, till the fire<lb/>
might yield the heated course.<lb/>

    
“Again they served<lb/>
new wine, but mellow; and a second course:<lb/>
sweet nuts, dried figs and wrinkled dates and plums,<lb/>
and apples fragrant, in wide baskets heaped;<lb/>
and, in a wreath of grapes from purple vines,<lb/>
concealed almost, a glistening honey-comb;<lb/>
and all these orchard dainties were enhanced<lb/>
by willing service and congenial smiles.<lb/>

    
“But while they served, the wine-bowl often drained,<lb/>
as often was replenished, though unfilled,<lb/>
and Baucis and Philemon, full of fear,<lb/>
as they observed the wine spontaneous well,<lb/>
increasing when it should diminish, raised<lb/>
their hands in supplication, and implored<lb/>
indulgence for their simple home and fare.<lb/>
And now, persuaded by this strange event<lb/>
such visitors were deities unknown,<lb/>
this aged couple, anxious to bestow<lb/>
their most esteemed possession, hastily<lb/>
began to chase the only goose they had—<lb/>
the faithful guardian of their little home —<lb/>
which they would kill and offer to the Gods.<lb/>
But swift of wing, at last it wearied them,<lb/>
and fled for refuge to the smiling Gods.<lb/>
At once the deities forbade their zeal,<lb/>
and said, ‘A righteous punishment shall fall<lb/>
severe upon this wicked neighborhood;<lb/>
but by the might of our divinity,<lb/>
no evil shall befall this humble home;<lb/>
but you must come, and follow as we climb<lb/>
the summit of this mountain!’<lb/>

    
“Both obeyed,<lb/>
and leaning on their staves toiled up the steep.<lb/>
Not farther from the summit than the flight<lb/>
of one swift arrow from a hunter's how,<lb/>
they paused to view their little home once more;<lb/>
and as they turned their eyes, they saw the fields<lb/>
around their own engulfed in a morass,<lb/>
although their own remained,—and while they wept<lb/>
bewailing the sad fate of many friends,<lb/>
and wondered at the change, they saw their home,<lb/>
so old and little for their simple need—<lb/>
put on new splendor, and as it increased<lb/>
it changed into a temple of the gods.<lb/>
Where first the frame was fashioned of rude stakes<lb/>
columns of marble glistened, and the thatch<lb/>
gleamed golden in the sun, and legends carved,<lb/>
adorned the doors. And al] the ground shone white<lb/>
with marble rich, and after this was done,<lb/>
the Son of Saturn said with gentle voice,<lb/>
‘Now tell us, good old man and you his wife,<lb/>
worthy and faithful, what is your desire?’<lb/>

    
“Philemon counselled with old Baucis first;<lb/>
and then discovered to the listening Gods<lb/>
their hearts' desire, ‘We pray you let us have<lb/>
the care of your new temple; and since we<lb/>
have passed so many years in harmony,<lb/>
let us depart this life together— Let<lb/>
the same hour take us both—I would not see<lb/>
the tomb of my dear wife; and let me not<lb/>
be destined to be buried by her hands!’<lb/>

    
“At once their wishes were fulfilled. So long<lb/>
as life was granted they were known to be<lb/>
the temple's trusted keepers, and when age<lb/>
had enervated them with many years,<lb/>
as they were standing, by some chance, before<lb/>
the sacred steps, and were relating all<lb/>
these things as they had happened, Baucis saw<lb/>
Philemon, her old husband, and he, too,<lb/>
saw Baucis, as their bodies put forth leaves;<lb/>
and while the tops of trees grew over them,<lb/>
above their faces, — they spoke each to each;<lb/>
as long as they could speak they said, ‘Farewell,<lb/>
farewell, my own’—and while they said farewell;<lb/>
new leaves and branches covered both at once.<lb/>

    
“The people of Tyana still point out<lb/>
two trees which grew there from a double trunk,<lb/>
two forms made into one. Old truthful men,<lb/>
who have no reason to deceive me, told<lb/>
me truly all that I have told to you,<lb/>
and I have seen the votive wreaths hung from<lb/>
the branches of the hallowed double-tree.<lb/>
And one time, as I hung fresh garlands there,<lb/>
I said, ‘Those whom the Gods care for are Gods!<lb/>
And those who worshiped are now worshiped here.’”<lb/>


Erysichthon. Fames.
PROTEUS

He ceased, and this miraculous event,<lb/>
and he who told it, had astonished them.<lb/>
But Theseus above all. The hero asked<lb/>
to hear of other wonders wrought by Gods.<lb/>
The Calydonian River-God replied,<lb/>
and leaning on one elbow, said to him:<lb/>

    
“There are, O valiant hero, other things<lb/>
whose forms once-changed as these, have so remained,<lb/>
but there are some who take on many shapes,<lb/>
as you have, Proteus, dweller of the deep—<lb/>
the deep whose arms embrace the earth. For some<lb/>
have seen you as a youth, then as a lion,<lb/>
a furious boar one time, a serpent next,<lb/>
so dreadful to the touch—and sometimes horns<lb/>
have made you seem a bull—or now a stone,<lb/>
or now a tree, or now a slipping stream,<lb/>
or even—the foe of water—next a fire.”<lb/>

ERYSICHTHON AND MESTRA

Now Erysichthon's daughter, Mestra, had<lb/>
that power of Proteus—she was called the wife<lb/>
of deft Autolycus.—Her father spurned<lb/>
the majesty of all the Gods, and gave<lb/>
no honor to their altars. It is said<lb/>
he violated with an impious axe<lb/>
the sacred grove of Ceres, and he cut<lb/>
her trees with iron. Long-standing in her grove<lb/>
there grew an ancient oak tree, spread so wide,<lb/>
alone it seemed a standing forest; and<lb/>
its trunk and branches held memorials,<lb/>
as, fillets, tablets, garlands, witnessing<lb/>
how many prayers the goddess Ceres granted.<lb/>
And underneath it laughing Dryads loved<lb/>
to whirl in festal dances, hand in hand,<lb/>
encircling its enormous trunk, that thrice<lb/>
five ells might measure; and to such a height<lb/>
it towered over all the trees around,<lb/>
as they were higher than the grass beneath.<lb/>

    
But Erysichthon, heedless of all things,<lb/>
ordered his slaves to fell the sacred oak,<lb/>
and as they hesitated, in a rage<lb/>
the wretch snatched from the hand of one an axe,<lb/>
and said, “If this should be the only oak<lb/>
loved by the goddess of this very grove,<lb/>
or even were the goddess in this tree,<lb/>
I'll level to the ground its leafy head.”<lb/>
So boasted he, and while he swung on high<lb/>
his axe to strike a slanting blow, the oak<lb/>
beloved of Ceres, uttered a deep groan<lb/>
and shuddered. Instantly its dark green leaves<lb/>
turned pale, and all its acorns lost their green,<lb/>
and even its long branches drooped their arms.<lb/>
But when his impious hand had struck the trunk,<lb/>
and cut its bark, red blood poured from the wound,—<lb/>
as when a weighty sacrificial bull<lb/>
has fallen at the altar, streaming blood<lb/>
spouts from his stricken neck. All were amazed.<lb/>
And one of his attendants boldly tried<lb/>
to stay his cruel axe, and hindered him;<lb/>
but Erysichthon, fixing his stern eyes<lb/>
upon him, said, “Let this, then, be the price<lb/>
of all your pious worship!” So he turned<lb/>
the poised axe from the tree, and clove his head<lb/>
sheer from his body, and again began<lb/>
to chop the hard oak. From the heart of it<lb/>
these words were uttered; “Covered by the bark<lb/>
of this oak tree I long have dwelt a Nymph,<lb/>
beloved of Ceres, and before my death<lb/>
it has been granted me to prophesy,<lb/>
that I may die contented. Punishment<lb/>
for this vile deed stands waiting at your side.”<lb/>

    
No warning could avert his wicked arm.<lb/>
Much weakened by his countless blows, the tree,<lb/>
pulled down by straining ropes, gave way at last<lb/>
and leveled with its weight uncounted trees<lb/>
that grew around it. Terrified and shocked,<lb/>
the sister-dryads, grieving for the grove<lb/>
and what they lost, put on their sable robes<lb/>
and hastened unto Ceres, whom they prayed,<lb/>
might rightly punish Erysichthon's crime;—<lb/>
the lovely goddess granted their request,<lb/>
and by the gracious movement of her head<lb/>
she shook the fruitful, cultivated fields,<lb/>
then heavy with the harvest; and she planned<lb/>
an unexampled punishment deserved,<lb/>
and not beyond his miserable crimes—<lb/>
the grisly bane of famine; but because<lb/>
it is not in the scope of Destiny,<lb/>
that two such deities should ever meet<lb/>
as Ceres and gaunt Famine,—calling forth<lb/>
from mountain-wilds a rustic Oread,<lb/>
the goddess Ceres, said to her, “There is<lb/>
an ice-bound wilderness of barren soil<lb/>
in utmost Scythia, desolate and bare<lb/>
of trees and corn, where Torpid-Frost, White-Death<lb/>
and Palsy and Gaunt-Famine, hold their haunts;<lb/>
go there now, and command that Famine flit<lb/>
from there; and let her gnawing-essence pierce<lb/>
the entrails of this sacrilegious wretch,<lb/>
and there be hidden—Let her vanquish me<lb/>
and overcome the utmost power of food.<lb/>
Heed not misgivings of the journey's length,<lb/>
for you will guide my dragon-bridled car<lb/>
through lofty ether.”<lb/>


    
And she gave to her<lb/>
the reins; and so the swiftly carried Nymph<lb/>
arrived in Scythia. There, upon the told<lb/>
of steepy Caucasus, when she had slipped<lb/>
their tight yoke from the dragons' harnessed necks,<lb/>
she searched for Famine in that granite land,<lb/>
and there she found her clutching at scant herbs,<lb/>
with nails and teeth. Beneath her shaggy hair<lb/>
her hollow eyes glared in her ghastly face,<lb/>
her lips were filthy and her throat was rough<lb/>
and blotched, and all her entrails could be seen,<lb/>
enclosed in nothing but her shriveled skin;<lb/>
her crooked loins were dry uncovered bones,<lb/>
and where her belly should be was a void;<lb/>
her flabby breast was flat against her spine;<lb/>
her lean, emaciated body made<lb/>
her joints appear so large, her knobbled knees<lb/>
seemed large knots, and her swollen ankle-bones<lb/>
protruded.<lb/>

    
When the Nymph, with keen sight, saw<lb/>
the Famine-monster, fearing to draw near<lb/>
she cried aloud the mandate she had brought<lb/>
from fruitful Ceres, and although the time<lb/>
had been but brief, and Famine far away,<lb/>
such hunger seized the Nymph, she had to turn<lb/>
her dragon-steeds, and flee through yielding air<lb/>
and the high clouds;—at Thessaly she stopped.<lb/>

    
Grim Famine hastened to obey the will<lb/>
of Ceres, though their deeds are opposite,<lb/>
and rapidly through ether heights was borne<lb/>
to Erysichthon's home. When she arrived<lb/>
at midnight, slumber was upon the wretch,<lb/>
and as she folded him in her two wings,<lb/>
she breathed her pestilential poison through<lb/>
his mouth and throat and breast, and spread the curse<lb/>
of utmost hunger in his aching veins.<lb/>

    
When all was done as Ceres had decreed,<lb/>
she left the fertile world for bleak abodes,<lb/>
and her accustomed caves. While this was done<lb/>
sweet Sleep with charming pinion soothed the mind<lb/>
of Erysichthon. In a dreamful feast<lb/>
he worked his jaws in vain, and ground his teeth,<lb/>
and swallowed air as his imagined food;<lb/>
till wearied with the effort he awoke<lb/>
to hunger scorching as a fire, which burned<lb/>
his entrails and compelled his raging jaws,<lb/>
so he, demanding all the foods of sea<lb/>
and earth and air, raged of his hunger, while<lb/>
the tables groaned with heaps before him spread;<lb/>
he, banqueting, sought banquets for more food,<lb/>
and as he gorged he always wanted more.<lb/>

    
The food of cities and a nation failed<lb/>
to satisfy the cravings of one man.<lb/>
The more his stomach gets, the more it needs —<lb/>
even as the ocean takes the streams of earth,<lb/>
although it swallows up great rivers drawn<lb/>
from lands remote, it never can be filled<lb/>
nor satisfied. And as devouring fire<lb/>
its fuel refuses never, but consumes<lb/>
unnumbered beams of wood, and burns for more<lb/>
the more 'tis fed, and from abundance gains<lb/>
increasing famine, so the raving jaws<lb/>
of wretched Erysichthon, ever craved<lb/>
all food in him, was on]y cause of food,<lb/>
and what he ate made only room for more.<lb/>

    
And after Famine through his gluttony<lb/>
at last had wasted his ancestral wealth<lb/>
his raging hunger suffered no decline,<lb/>
and his insatiate gluttony increased.<lb/>
When all his wealth at last was eaten up,<lb/>
his daughter, worthy of a fate more kind,<lb/>
alone was left to him and her he sold.<lb/>
Descendant of a noble race, the girl<lb/>
refusing to be purchased as a slave,<lb/>
then hastened to the near shore of the sea,<lb/>
and as she stretched her arms above the waves,<lb/>
implored kind Neptune with her tears, “Oh, you<lb/>
who have deprived me of virginity,<lb/>
deliver me from such a master's power!”<lb/>

    
Although the master, seeking her, had seen<lb/>
her only at that moment, Neptune changed<lb/>
her quickly from a woman to a man,<lb/>
by giving her the features of a man<lb/>
and garments proper to a fisher-man:<lb/>
and there she stood. He even looked at her<lb/>
and cried out, “Hey, there! Expert of the rod!<lb/>
While you are casting forth the bit of brass,<lb/>
concealed so deftly in its tiny bait,—<lb/>
gods-willing! let the sea be smooth for you,<lb/>
and let the foolish fishes swimming up,<lb/>
never know danger till they snap the hook!<lb/>
Now tell me where is she, who only now,<lb/>
in tattered garment and wind-twisted hair,<lb/>
was standing on this shore—for I am sure<lb/>
I saw her standing on this shore, although<lb/>
no footstep shows her flight.”<lb/>

    
By this assured<lb/>
the favor of the god protected her;<lb/>
delighted to be questioned of herself,<lb/>
she said, “No matter who you are, excuse me.<lb/>
So busy have I been at catching fish,<lb/>
I have not had the time to move my eyes<lb/>
from this pool; and that you may be assured<lb/>
I only tell the truth, may Neptune, God<lb/>
of ocean witness it, I have not seen a man<lb/>
where I am standing on this shore—myself<lb/>
excepted—not a woman has stood here.”<lb/>

    
Her master could not doubt it, and deceived<lb/>
retraced his footsteps from the sandy shore.<lb/>
As soon as he had disappeared, her form<lb/>
unchanged, was given back to her. But when<lb/>
her father knew his daughter could transform<lb/>
her body and escape, he often sold<lb/>
her first to one and then another—all<lb/>
of whom she cheated— as a mare, bird,<lb/>
a cow, or as a stag she got away; and so<lb/>
brought food, dishonestly, to ease his greed.<lb/>

    
And so he lived until the growing strength<lb/>
of famine, gnawing at his vitals, had<lb/>
consumed all he could get by selling her:<lb/>
his anguish burned him with increasing heat.<lb/>
He gnawed his own flesh, and he tore his limbs<lb/>
and fed his body all he took from it. <lb/>

    
ah, why should I dwell on the wondrous deeds<lb/>
of others—Even I, O gathered youths,<lb/>
have such a power I can often change<lb/>
my body till my limit has been reached.<lb/>
A while appearing in my real form,<lb/>
another moment coiled up as a snake,<lb/>
then as a monarch of the herd my strength<lb/>
increases in my horns—my strength increased<lb/>
in my two horns when I had two—but now<lb/>
my forehead, as you see, has lost one horn.<lb/>
And having ended with such words,—he groaned.<lb/>

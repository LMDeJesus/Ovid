PHAETHON AND PHOEBUS

Glowing with gold, flaming with carbuncles<lb/>
on stately columns raised, refulgent shone<lb/>
the palace of the Sun, with polished dome<lb/>
of ivory gleaming, and with portals twain<lb/>
of burnished silver. And the workmanship<lb/>
exceeded all the wealth of gems and gold;<lb/>
for there had Mulciber engraved the seas<lb/>
encircling middle earth; the round of earth,<lb/>
and heaven impending over the land.<lb/>

    
And there<lb/>
amid the waves were azure deities:<lb/>
melodious Triton and elusive Proteus; there<lb/>
Aegeaan pressing with his arms the backs.<lb/>
Of monstrous whales; and Doris in the sea<lb/>
and all her daughters; some amid the waves<lb/>
and others sitting on the bank to dry<lb/>
their sea-green hair, and others borne about<lb/>
by fishes. Each was made to show a fair<lb/>
resemblance to her sisters—yet not one<lb/>
appearance was assigned to all—they seemed<lb/>
as near alike as sisters should in truth.<lb/>
And men and cities, woods and savage beasts,<lb/>
and streams and nymphs, and sylvan deities<lb/>
were carved upon the land; and over these<lb/>
an image of the glittering sky was fixed;—<lb/>
six signs were on the right, six on the left.<lb/>

    
Here when audacious Phaethon arrived<lb/>
by steep ascending paths, without delay<lb/>
he entered in the shining palace-gates<lb/>
of his reputed parent, making haste<lb/>
to stand in his paternal presence. There,<lb/>
unable to endure the dazzling light,<lb/>
he waited at a distance.<lb/>

    
Phoebus sat,<lb/>
arrayed in royal purple, on a throne<lb/>
that glittered with the purest emeralds.—  <lb/>
there to the left and right, Day, Month and Year,<lb/>
time and the Hours, at equal distance stood;<lb/>
and vernal Spring stood crowned with wreathed flowers;<lb/>
and naked Summer stood with sheaves of wheat;<lb/>
and Autumn stood besmeared with trodden grapes;<lb/>
and icy Winter rough with hoary hair.<lb/>

    
And from the midst, with orbs that view the world,<lb/>
Phoebus beheld the trembling youth, fear-struck,<lb/>
in mute amazement, and he said; “Declare<lb/>
the reason of thy journey. What wilt thou<lb/>
in this my palace, Phaethon my child<lb/>
beloved?”<lb/>

    
And to him replied the youth;<lb/>
“O universal light of all the world,<lb/>
my father Phoebus, if thy name be mine,<lb/>
if Clymene has not concealed her sin<lb/>
beneath some pretext, give to me, my sire,<lb/>
a token to declare thy fatherhood<lb/>
which may establish my assured descent,<lb/>
and leave no dark suspicions in our minds.”—<lb/>

    
then Phoebus from his shining brows cast down<lb/>
his circling rays; called Phaethon to him,<lb/>
and as he held him to his breast replied;<lb/>

“O child most worthy of thy sire, the truth<lb/>
was told thee by thy mother; wherefore doubts<lb/>
to dissipate, consider thy desire,<lb/>
and ask of me that I may freely give:<lb/>
yea, let the Nether Lake, beyond our view,<lb/>
(which is the oath of Gods inviolate)<lb/>
be witness to my word.”<lb/>

    
When this was said<lb/>
the happy youth at once began to plead<lb/>
command and guidance of his father's steeds,<lb/>
wing-footed, and his chariot for a day.<lb/>

    
But Phoebus much repented that he sware,<lb/>
and thrice and four times shook his radiant head;<lb/>
“Ah, would I might refuse my plighted word;<lb/>
and oh, that it were lawful to deny<lb/>
the promised boon.—For I confess, O son,<lb/>
this only I should keep from thee—and yet<lb/>
'Tis lawful to dissuade. It is unsafe<lb/>
to satisfy thy will. It is a great<lb/>
request, O Phaethon, which neither suits<lb/>
thy utmost strength nor tender years; for thou<lb/>
art mortal, and thou hast aspired to things<lb/>
immortal. Ignorance has made thy thought<lb/>
transcend the province of the Gods. I vaunt<lb/>
no vain exploits; but only I can stand<lb/>
securely on the flame-fraught axle-tree:<lb/>
even the Ruler of Olympian Gods,<lb/>
who hurls fierce lightnings with his great right hand,<lb/>
may never dare to drive this chariot,<lb/>
and what art thou to equal mighty Jove?<lb/>

“The opening path is steep and difficult,<lb/>
for scarcely can the steeds, refreshed at dawn,<lb/>
climb up the steeps: and when is reached the height,<lb/>
extreme of midmost Heaven, and sea and earth<lb/>
are viewed below, my trembling breast is filled<lb/>
with fearful apprehensions: and requires<lb/>
the last precipitous descent a sure<lb/>
command. Then, also, Tethys, who receives<lb/>
me in her subject waves, is wont to fear<lb/>
lest I should fall disastrous. And around<lb/>
the hastening sky revolves in constant whirl,<lb/>
drawing the lofty stars with rapid twist.<lb/>

“I struggle on. The force that overcomes<lb/>
the heavenly bodies overwhelms me not,<lb/>
and I am borne against that rapid globe.<lb/>
Suppose the chariot thine: what canst thou do?<lb/>
Canst thou drive straight against the twisted pole<lb/>
and not be carried from the lofty path<lb/>
by the swift car? Art thou deceived to think<lb/>
there may be groves and cities of the Gods,<lb/>
and costly temples wondrously endowed?<lb/>

“The journey is beset with dreadful snares<lb/>
and shapes of savage animals. If thou<lb/>
shouldst hold upon thy way without mistake<lb/>
yet must thy journey be through Taurus' horns,<lb/>
and through the Bow Haemonian, and the jaws<lb/>
of the fierce Lion, and the cruel arms<lb/>
of Scorpion, bent throughout a vast expanse,—<lb/>
and Cancer's curving arms reversely bent.<lb/>

“It is no easy task for thee to rule<lb/>
the mettled four-foot steeds, enflamed in fires<lb/>
that kindle in their breasts, forth issuing<lb/>
in breathings from their mouths and nostrils hot;—<lb/>
I scarce restrain them, as their struggling necks<lb/>
pull on the harness, when their heated fires<lb/>
are thus aroused.<lb/>

“And, O my son, lest I<lb/>
may be the author of a baneful gift,<lb/>
beware, and as the time permits recall<lb/>
thy rash request. Forsooth thou hast besought<lb/>
undoubted signs of thy descent from me?<lb/>
My fears for thee are certain signs that thou<lb/>
art of my race—by my paternal fears<lb/>
'Tis manifest I am thy father. Lo!<lb/>
Behold my countenance! and oh, that thou<lb/>
couldst even pierce my bosom with thine eyes,<lb/>
and so discover my paternal cares!<lb/>

“Look round thee on the treasured world's delights<lb/>
and ask the greatest blessing of the sky,<lb/>
or sea or land, and thou shalt suffer no<lb/>
repulse: but only this I must deplore,<lb/>
which rightly named would be a penalty<lb/>
and not an honour.—Thou hast made request<lb/>
of punishment and not a gift indeed.<lb/>
O witless boy! why dost thou hold my neck<lb/>
with thy caressing arms? For, doubt it not,<lb/>
as I have sworn it by the Stygian Waves,<lb/>
whatever thou shalt wish, it shall be given—<lb/>
but thou shouldst wish more wisely.”<lb/>


    
So were all<lb/>
his admonitions said, availing naught;<lb/>
for Phaethon resisted his advice,<lb/>
and urged again his claim, and eagerly burned<lb/>
to use the chariot. Wherefore, Phoebus long<lb/>
delaying and reluctant, took the youth<lb/>
to view the spacious chariot, gift of Vulcan.—<lb/>
gold was the axle and the beam was gold,<lb/>
the great Wheel had a golden tire and spokes<lb/>
of silver; chrysolites and diamonds<lb/>
reflected from the spangled yoke the light<lb/>
of Phoebus.<lb/>

    
While aspiring Phaethon admired<lb/>
the glittering chariot and its workmanship,<lb/>
the vigilant Aurora opened forth<lb/>
her purple portals from the ruddy east,<lb/>
disclosing halls replete with roses. All<lb/>
the stars took flight, while Lucifer, the last<lb/>
to quit his vigil, gathered that great host<lb/>
and disappeared from his celestial watch.<lb/>

    
And when his father, Phoebus, saw the earth<lb/>
and the wide universe in glowing tints<lb/>
arrayed, as waned the Moon's diminished horns,<lb/>
far-distant, then he bade the nimble Hours<lb/>
to yoke the steeds.—At once the Deities<lb/>
accomplished his commands, and led the steeds,<lb/>
ambrosia-fed and snorting flames, from out<lb/>
their spacious stalls; and fixed their sounding bits.<lb/>

    
Then with a hallowed drug the father touched<lb/>
the stripling's face, to make him proof against<lb/>
the rapid flame, and wrought around his hair<lb/>
the sun-rays. But, foreboding grief, he said,<lb/>
while many a sigh heaved from his anxious breast;<lb/>
“If thou canst only heed thy father's voice—<lb/>
be sparing of the whip and use with nerve<lb/>
the reins; for of their own accord the steeds<lb/>
will hasten. Difficult are they to check<lb/>
in full career. Thou must not drive the car<lb/>
directly through five circles, for the track<lb/>
takes a wide curve, obliquely, and is bound<lb/>
by the extreme edge of three zones.—It avoids<lb/>
the Southern Pole, and it avoids the Bear<lb/>
that roams around the north. The way is plain;<lb/>
the traces of the Wheel are manifest.<lb/>

“Observe with care that both the earth and sky<lb/>
have their appropriate heat—Drive not too low,<lb/>
nor urge the chariot through the highest plane;<lb/>
for if thy course attain too great a height<lb/>
thou wilt consume the mansions of the sky,<lb/>
and if too low the land will scorch with heat.<lb/>

“Take thou the middle plane, where all is safe;<lb/>
nor let the Wheel turn over to the right<lb/>
and bear thee to the twisted Snake! nor let<lb/>
it take thee to the Altar on the left—<lb/>
so close to earth—but steer the middle course.—<lb/>
to Fortune I commit thy fate, whose care<lb/>
for thee so reckless of thyself I pray.<lb/>

“While I am speaking humid night has touched<lb/>
the margin of Hesperian shores. 'Tis not<lb/>
for us to idle; we are called away;—<lb/>
when bright Aurora shines the darkness flies.<lb/>
Take up the reins! But if thy stubborn breast<lb/>
be capable of change use not our car,<lb/>
but heed my counsel while the time permits,<lb/>
and while thy feet are on a solid base,<lb/>
but not, according to thy foolish wish,<lb/>
pressing the axle. Rather let me light<lb/>
the world beneath thy safe and wondering gaze.”<lb/>

    
But Phaethon with youthful vigor leaped,<lb/>
and in the light-made chariot lightly stood:<lb/>
and he rejoiced, and with the reins in hand<lb/>
thanked his reluctant parent.<lb/>

    
Instantly<lb/>
Eous, Aethon, Pyrois and Phlegon,<lb/>
the winged horses of the Sun, gave vent<lb/>
to flame-like neighs that filled the shaking air;<lb/>
they pawed the barriers with their shining hoofs.<lb/>
Then Tethys, witless of her grandson's fate<lb/>
let back the barriers,—and the universe<lb/>
was theirs to traverse. Taking the well-known road,<lb/>
and moving through the air with winged feet,<lb/>
they pierced resisting clouds, and spreading wide<lb/>
their pinions soared upon the eastern wind,<lb/>
far-wafted from that realm. But Phaethon,<lb/>
so easy of their yoke, lost all control,<lb/>
and the great car was tossed,—as tapered ships<lb/>
when lightened of their ballast toss and heave<lb/>
unsteady in the surging seas: the car<lb/>
leaped lightly in the air, and in the heights<lb/>
was tossed unsteady as an empty shell.<lb/>

    
Soon as the steeds perceived it, with a rush<lb/>
impetuous, they left the beaten track;<lb/>
regardless of all order and control;<lb/>
and Phaethon filled with fear, knew not to guide<lb/>
with trusted reins, nor where the way might be—<lb/>
nor, if he knew, could he control their flight.<lb/>

    
Warmed in the sunshine, never felt before,<lb/>
the gelid Triones attempted vain<lb/>
to bathe in seas forbid: the Serpent cold<lb/>
and torpid by the frozen Pole, too cold<lb/>
for contest, warmed, and rage assumed from heat<lb/>
bootes, troubled by the heat, took flight,<lb/>
impeded by his wain.<lb/>

    
And as from skies<lb/>
of utmost height unhappy Phaethon<lb/>
beheld the earth receding from his view,<lb/>
a pallor spread his cheeks with sudden fear;<lb/>
his knees began to quake; and through the flare<lb/>
of vast effulgence darkness closed his eyes.<lb/>
Now vainy he regrets he ever touched<lb/>
his father's steeds, and he is stunned with grief<lb/>
that so entreating he prevailed to know<lb/>
his true descent. He rather would be called<lb/>
the son of Merops. As a ship is tossed<lb/>
by raging Boreas, when the conquered helm<lb/>
has been abandoned, and the pilot leaves<lb/>
the vessel to his vows and to the Gods;<lb/>
so, helpless, he is borne along the sky.<lb/>

    
What can he? Much of heaven remains behind;<lb/>
a longer distance is in front of him—<lb/>
each way is measured in his anxious mind.—<lb/>
at first his gaze is fixed upon the west,<lb/>
which fate has destined he shall never reach,<lb/>
and then his eyes turn backward to the east.—<lb/>
so, stupefied and dazed he neither dares<lb/>
to loose the bits, nor tighten on the reins,<lb/>
and he is ignorant of the horses' names.<lb/>


    
He sees horrific wonders scattered round,<lb/>
and images of hideous animals.—<lb/>
and there's a spot where Scorpion bends his claws<lb/>
in double circles, and with tail and arms<lb/>
on either side, stretches his limbs throughout<lb/>
the space of two Celestial Signs; and when<lb/>
the lad beheld him, steeped in oozing slime<lb/>
of venom, swart, and threatening to strike<lb/>
grim wounds with jagged spear-points, he was lost;<lb/>
and, fixed in chills of horror, dropped the reins.<lb/>

    
When these they felt upon their rising backs,<lb/>
the startled steeds sprang forthwith; and, unchecked,<lb/>
through atmospheres of regions unexplored,<lb/>
thence goaded by their unchecked violence,<lb/>
broke through the lawful bounds, and rushed upon<lb/>
the high fixed stars. They dragged the chariot<lb/>
through devious ways, and soared amid the heights;<lb/>
dashed down deep pathways, far, precipitous,<lb/>
and gained a level near the scorching earth.<lb/>

    
Phoebe is wondering that her brother's steeds<lb/>
run lower than her own, and sees the smoke<lb/>
of scorching clouds. The highest altitudes<lb/>
are caught in flames, and as their moistures dry<lb/>
they crack in chasms. The grass is blighted; trees<lb/>
are burnt up with their leaves; the ripe brown crops<lb/>
give fuel for self destruction—Oh what small<lb/>
complaints! Great cities perish with their walls,<lb/>
and peopled nations are consumed to dust—<lb/>
the forests and the mountains are destroyed.<lb/>

    
Cilician Taurus, Athos and Tmolus,<lb/>
and Oeta are burning; and the far-famed Ida<lb/>
and all her cooling rills are dry and burning,<lb/>
and virgin Helicon, and Hoemos—later<lb/>
Oeagrius called—and Aetna with tremendous,<lb/>
redoubled flames, and double-peaked Parnassus,<lb/>
Sicilian Eryx, Cynthus—Othrys, pine-clad,<lb/>
and Rhodope, deprived his snowy mantle,<lb/>
and Dindyma and Mycale and Mimas,<lb/>
and Mount Cithaeron, famed for sacred rites:<lb/>
and Scythia, though a land of frost, is burning,<lb/>
and Caucasus,—and Ossa burns with Pindus,—<lb/>
and greater than those two Olympus burns—<lb/>
the lofty Alps, the cloud-topped Apennines.<lb/>

    
And Phaethon, as he inhaled the air,<lb/>
burning and scorching as a furnace blast,<lb/>
and saw destruction on the flaming world,<lb/>
and his great chariot wreathed in quenchless fires,<lb/>
was suddenly unable to endure the heat,<lb/>
the smoke and cinders, and he swooned away.—<lb/>
if he had known the way, those winged steeds<lb/>
would rush as wild unguided.—<lb/>

    
then the skin<lb/>
of Ethiopians took a swarthy hue,<lb/>
the hot blood tingling to the surface: then<lb/>
the heat dried up the land of Libya;<lb/>
dishevelled, the lorn Nymphs, lamenting, sought<lb/>
for all their emptied springs and lakes in vain;<lb/>
Boeotia wailed for Dirce's cooling wave,<lb/>
and Argos wailed for Amymone's stream—<lb/>
and even Corinth for the clear Pyrene.<lb/>

    
Not safer from the flames were distant streams;—<lb/>
the Tanais in middle stream was steaming<lb/>
and old Peneus and Teuthrantian Caicus,<lb/>
Ismenus, rapid and Arcadian Erymanthus;<lb/>
and even Xanthus destined for a second burning,<lb/>
and tawny-waved Lycormas, and Meander,<lb/>
turning and twisting, and Thracian Melas burns,<lb/>
and the Laconian Eurotas burns,<lb/>
the mighty Babylonian Euphrates,<lb/>
Orontes and the Ganges, swift Thermodon,<lb/>
Ister and Phasis and Alpheus boil.<lb/>
The banks of Spercheus burn, the gold of Tagus<lb/>
is melting in the flames. The swans whose songs<lb/>

    
enhanced the beauties of Maeonian banks<lb/>
are scalded in the Cayster's middle wave.<lb/>
The Nile affrighted fled to parts remote,<lb/>
and hid his head forever from the world:<lb/>
now empty are his seven mouths, and dry<lb/>
without or wave or stream; and also dry<lb/>
Ismenian Hebrus, Strymon and the streams<lb/>
of Hesper-Land, the rivers Rhine and Rhone,<lb/>
and Po, and Tiber, ruler of the world.<lb/>

    
And even as the ground asunder burst,<lb/>
the light amazed in gloomy Tartarus<lb/>
the King Infernal and his Spouse. The sea<lb/>
contracted and his level waste became<lb/>
a sandy desert. The huge mountain tops,<lb/>
once covered by the ocean's waves, reared up,<lb/>
by which the scattered Cyclades increased.<lb/>
Even the fishes sought for deeper pools;—<lb/>
the crooked dolphins dared not skip the waves;<lb/>
the lifeless sea-calves floated on the top;<lb/>
and it is even famed that Nereus hid<lb/>
with Doris and her daughters, deep below<lb/>
in seething caverns. With a dauntless mien<lb/>
thrice Neptune tried to thrust his arms above<lb/>
the waters;—thrice the heated air overcame<lb/>
his courage.<lb/>

    
Then the genial Earth, although<lb/>
surrounded by the waters of the sea,<lb/>
was parched and dry; for all her streams had hid<lb/>
deep in the darkness of her winding caves.—<lb/>
she lifted her productive countenance,<lb/>
up to her rounded neck, and held her palms<lb/>
on her sad brows; and as the mountains huge<lb/>
trembled and tottered, beneath her wonted plane<lb/>
declined she for a space—and thus began,<lb/>
with parched voice;<lb/>

“If this is thy decree,<lb/>
O, Highest of the Gods,—if I have sinned<lb/>
why do thy lightnings linger? For if doomed<lb/>
by fires consuming I to perish must,<lb/>
let me now die in thy celestial flames—<lb/>
hurled by thine arm—and thus alleviate,<lb/>
by thine omnipotence, this agony.<lb/>

“How difficult to open my parched mouth,<lb/>
and speak these words! (the vapours choking her),<lb/>
behold my scorching hair, and see the clouds<lb/>
of ashes falling on my blinded eyes,<lb/>
and on my features! What a recompense<lb/>
for my fertility! How often I<lb/>
have suffered from the wounds of crooked plows<lb/>
and rending harrows—tortured year by year!<lb/>
For this I give to cattle juicy leaves<lb/>
and fruits to man and frankincense to thee!<lb/>

“Suppose destruction is my just award<lb/>
what have the waters and thy brother done?<lb/>
Why should thy brother's cooling waves decrease<lb/>
and thus recede so distant from the skies?<lb/>
If not thy brother's good nor mine may touch<lb/>
thy mercy, let the pity of thy Heaven,<lb/>
for lo, the smoking poles on either side<lb/>
attest, if flames consume them or destroy, <lb/>
the ruin of thy palace. Atlas, huge, <lb/>
with restive shoulders hardly can support<lb/>
the burning heavens. If the seas and lands<lb/>
together perish and thy palace fall, <lb/>
the universe confused will plunge once more<lb/>
to ancient Chaos. Save it from this wreck—<lb/>
if anything survive the fury of the flames.”<lb/>


    
So made the tortured Earth an end of speech;<lb/>
and she was fain to hide her countenance<lb/>
in caves that border on the nether night.<lb/>

    
But now the Almighty Father, having called<lb/>
to witness all the Gods of Heaven, and him<lb/>
who gave the car, that, else his power be shown,<lb/>
must perish all in dire confusion, high<lb/>
he mounted to the altitude from which<lb/>
he spreads the mantling clouds, and fulminates<lb/>
his dreadful thunders and swift lightning-bolts<lb/>
terrific.—Clouds were none to find on the earth, <lb/>
and the surrounding skies were void of rain.—<lb/>

    
Jove, having reached that summit, stood and poised<lb/>
in his almighty hand a flashing dart, <lb/>
and, hurling it, deprived of life and seat<lb/>
the youthful charioteer, and struck with fire<lb/>
the raging flames— and by the same great force<lb/>
those flames enveloping the earth were quenched,<lb/>
and he who caused their fury lost his life.<lb/>

    
Frantic in their affright the horses sprang<lb/>
across the bounded way and cast their yokes,<lb/>
and through the tangled harness lightly leaped.<lb/>
And here the scattered harness lay, and there<lb/>
the shattered axle, wrenched from off the pole,<lb/>
and various portions of the broken car;<lb/>
spokes of the broken Wheel were scattered round.<lb/>

    
And far fell Phaethon with flaming hair;<lb/>
as haply from the summer sky appears<lb/>
a falling star, although it never drops<lb/>
to startled earth.—Far distant from his home<lb/>
the deep Eridanus received the lad<lb/>
and bathed his foaming face. His body charred<lb/>
by triple flames Hesperian Naiads bore,<lb/>
still smoking, to a tomb, and this engraved<lb/>
upon the stone; “Here Phaethon's remains<lb/>
lie buried. He who drove his father's car<lb/>
and fell, although he made a great attempt.”<lb/>

    
Filled with consuming woe, his father hid<lb/>
his countenance which grief had overcast.<lb/>
And now, surpassing our belief, they say<lb/>
a day passed over with no glowing sun;—<lb/>
but light-affording flames appeared to change<lb/>
disaster to the cause of good.<lb/>

    
Amazed,<lb/>
the woeful Clymene, when she had moaned<lb/>
in grief, amid her lamentations tore<lb/>
her bosom, as across the world she roamed,<lb/>
at first to seek his lifeless corpse, and then<lb/>
his bones. She wandered to that distant land<lb/>
and found at last his bones ensepulchred.<lb/>
There, clinging to the grave she fell and bathed<lb/>
with many tears his name on marble carved,<lb/>
and with her bosom warmed the freezing <lb/>
stone.<lb/>

    
And all the daughters of the Sun went there<lb/>
giving their tears, alas a useless gift;—<lb/>
they wept and beat their breasts, and day and night<lb/>
called, “Phaethon,” who heard not any sound<lb/>
of their complaint:—and there they lay foredone,<lb/>
all scattered round the tomb.<lb/>

    
The silent moon<lb/>
had four times joined her horns and filled her disk,<lb/>
while they, according to an ancient rite,<lb/>
made lamentation. Prone upon the ground,<lb/>
the eldest, Phaethusa, would arise<lb/>
from there, but found her feet were growing stiff;<lb/>
and uttered moan. Lampetia wished to aid<lb/>
her sister but was hindered by new roots;<lb/>
a third when she would tear her hair, plucked forth<lb/>
but leaves: another wailed to find her legs<lb/>
were fastened in a tree; another moaned<lb/>
to find her arms to branches had been changed.<lb/>
And while they wondered, bark enclosed their thighs,<lb/>
and covered their smooth bellies, and their breasts,<lb/>
and shoulders and their hands, but left untouched<lb/>
their lips that called upon their mother's name.<lb/>
What can she do for them? Hither she runs<lb/>
and thither runs, wherever frenzy leads.<lb/>
She kisses them, alas, while yet she may!<lb/>

    
But not content with this, she tried to hale<lb/>
their bodies from the trees; and she would tear<lb/>
the tender branches with her hands, but lo!<lb/>
The blood oozed out as from a bleeding wound;<lb/>
and as she wounded them they shrieked aloud,<lb/>
“Spare me! O mother spare me; in the tree<lb/>
my flesh is torn! farewell! farewell! farewell!”<lb/>
And as they spoke the bark enclosed their lips.<lb/>

    
Their tears flow forth, and from the new-formed<lb/>
boughs<lb/>
amber distils and slowly hardens in the sun;<lb/>
and far from there upon the waves is borne<lb/>
to deck the Latin women.<lb/>

    
Cycnus, son<lb/>
of Sthenelus, by his maternal house<lb/>
akin to Phaethon, and thrice by love<lb/>
allied, beheld this wonderful event.—<lb/>
he left his kingdom of Liguria,<lb/>
and all its peopled cities, to lament<lb/>
where the sad sisters had increased the woods,<lb/>
beside the green banks of Eridanus.<lb/>

    
There, as he made complaint, his manly voice<lb/>
began to pipe a treble, shrill; and long<lb/>
gray plumes concealed his hair. A slender neck<lb/>
extended from his breast, and reddening toes<lb/>
were joined together by a membrane. Wings<lb/>
grew from his sides, and from his mouth was made<lb/>
a blunted beak. Now Cycnus is a swan,<lb/>
and yet he fears to trust the skies and Jove,<lb/>
for he remembers fires, unjustly sent,<lb/>
and therefore shuns the heat that he abhors,<lb/>
and haunts the spacious lakes and pools and streams<lb/>
that quench the fires.<lb/>

    
In squalid garb, meanwhile,<lb/>
and destitute of all his rays, the sire<lb/>
of Phaethon, as dark as when eclipse bedims<lb/>
his Wheel, abhors himself and hates the light,<lb/>
shuns the bright day, gives up his mind to grief,<lb/>
adds passion to his woe, denies the earth<lb/>
his countenance, and thus laments; “My lot<lb/>
was ever restless from the dawn of time,<lb/>
and I am weary of this labour, void<lb/>
and endless. Therefore, let who will urge forth<lb/>
my car, light-bearing, and if none may dare,<lb/>
when all the Gods of Heaven acknowledge it,<lb/>
let Jove himself essay the task. Perchance,<lb/>
when he takes up the reins, he may forget<lb/>
his dreadful lightning that bereaves of child<lb/>
a father's love; and as he tries the strength<lb/>
of those flame-footed steeds will know, in truth,<lb/>
the lad who failed to guide my chariot<lb/>
deserved not death.”<lb/>

    
But all the Deities<lb/>
encircle Phoebus as he makes complaint,<lb/>
and with their supplications they entreat<lb/>
him not to plunge the world in darkness. Jove<lb/>
would find excuses for the lightning-bolt,<lb/>
hurled from his hand, and adds imperious threats<lb/>
to his entreaties. Phoebus calls his steeds,<lb/>
frenzied with their maddening fires, and <lb/>
breaks<lb/>
their fury, as he vents with stinging lash<lb/>
his rage upon them, and in passion lays<lb/>
on them the death of Phaethon his son.<lb/>


Callisto.
CALISTO AND JUPITER

Now after Phaethon had suffered death<lb/>
for the vast ruin wrought by scorching flames,<lb/>
all the great walls of Heaven's circumference,<lb/>
unmeasured, views the Father of the Gods,<lb/>
with searching care, that none impaired by heat<lb/>
may fall in ruins. Well assured they stand<lb/>
in self-sustaining strength, his view, at last,<lb/>
on all the mundane works of man is turned;—<lb/>
his loving gaze long resting on his own<lb/>
Arcadia. And he starts the streams and springs<lb/>
that long have feared to flow; paints the wide earth<lb/>
with verdant fields; covers the trees with leaves,<lb/>
and clothes the injured forests in their green.<lb/>

    
While wandering in the world, he stopped amazed,<lb/>
when he beheld the lovely Nymph, Calisto,<lb/>
and fires of love were kindled in his breast.<lb/>

    
Calisto was not clothed in sumptuous robes,<lb/>
nor did she deck her hair in artful coils;<lb/>
but with a buckle she would gird her robe,<lb/>
and bind her long hair with a fillet white.<lb/>
She bore a slender javelin in her hand,<lb/>
or held the curving bow; and thus in arms<lb/>
as chaste Diana, none of Maenalus<lb/>
was loved by that fair goddess more than she.<lb/>

    
But everything must change. When bright the sun<lb/>
rolled down the sky, beyond his middle course,<lb/>
she pierced a secret thicket, known to her,<lb/>
and having slipped the quiver from her arm,<lb/>
she loosed the bended bow, and softly down<lb/>
upon the velvet turf reclining, pressed<lb/>
her white neck on the quiver while she slept.<lb/>

    
When Jupiter beheld her, negligent<lb/>
and beautiful, he argued thus, “How can<lb/>
my consort, Juno, learn of this? And yet,<lb/>
if chance should give her knowledge, what care I?<lb/>
Let gain offset the scolding of her tongue!”<lb/>

    
This said, the god transformed himself and took<lb/>
Diana's form—assumed Diana's dress  <lb/>
and imitating her awoke the maid,<lb/>
and spoke in gentle tones, “What mountain slope,<lb/>
O virgin of my train, hath been thy chase?”<lb/>
Which, having heard, Calisto, rose and said,<lb/>
“Hail, goddess! greater than celestial Jove!<lb/>
I would declare it though he heard the words.”<lb/>

    
Jove heard and smiled, well pleased to be preferred<lb/>
above himself, and kissed her many times,<lb/>
and strained her in his arms, while she began<lb/>
to tell the varied fortunes of her hunt.—<lb/>
but when his ardent love was known to her,<lb/>
she struggled to escape from his embrace:<lb/>
ah, how could she, a tender maid, resist<lb/>
almighty Jove?—Be sure, Saturnia<lb/>
if thou hadst only witnessed her thy heart<lb/>
had shown more pity!—<lb/>

    
Jupiter on wings,<lb/>
transcendent, sought his glorious heights;<lb/>
but she, in haste departing from that grove,<lb/>
almost forgot her quiver and her bow.<lb/>

    
Behold, Diana, with her virgin train,<lb/>
when hunting on the slopes of Maenalus,<lb/>
amidst the pleasures of exciting sport,<lb/>
espied the Nymph and called her, who, afraid<lb/>
that Jove apparelled in disguise deceived,<lb/>
drew backward for a moment, till appeared<lb/>
to her the lovely Nymphs that followed: thus,<lb/>
assured deceit was none, she ventured near.<lb/>

    
Alas, how difficult to hide disgrace!<lb/>
She could not raise her vision from the ground,<lb/>
nor as the leader of the hunting Nymphs,<lb/>
as was her wont, walk by the goddess' side.<lb/>
Her silence and her blushes were the signs<lb/>
of injured honour. Ah Diana, thou,<lb/>
if thou wert not a virgin, wouldst perceive<lb/>
and pity her unfortunate distress.<lb/>

    
The Moon's bent horns were rising from their ninth<lb/>
sojourn, when, fainting from Apollo's flames,<lb/>
the goddess of the Chase observed a cool<lb/>
umbrageous grove, from which a murmuring stream<lb/>
ran babbling gently over golden sands.<lb/>
When she approved the spot, lightly she struck<lb/>
her foot against the ripples of the stream,<lb/>
and praising it began; “Far from the gaze<lb/>
of all the curious we may bathe our limbs,<lb/>
and sport in this clear water.” Quickly they<lb/>
undid their garments,—but Calisto hid<lb/>
behind the others, till they knew her state.—<lb/>
Diana in a rage exclaimed, “Away!<lb/>
Thou must not desecrate our sacred springs!”<lb/>
And she was driven thence.<lb/>


    
Ere this transpired,<lb/>
observed the consort of the Thunder-God<lb/>
her altered mien; but she for ripening time<lb/>
withheld severe resentment. Now delay<lb/>
was needless for distracted Juno heard<lb/>
Calisto of the god of Heaven had borne<lb/>
a boy called Arcas. Full of jealous rage,<lb/>
her eyes and thoughts enkindled as she cried;<lb/>

“And only this was wanting to complete<lb/>
your wickedness, that you should bear a son<lb/>
and flaunt abroad the infamy of Jove!<lb/>
Unpunished you shall not escape, for I<lb/>
will spoil the beauty that has made you proud<lb/>
and dazzled Jupiter with wanton art.”<lb/>

    
So saying, by her forehead's tresses seized<lb/>
the goddess on her rival; and she dragged<lb/>
her roughly to the ground. Pleading she raised<lb/>
her suppliant arms and begged for mercy.—While<lb/>
she pled, black hair spread over her white limbs;<lb/>
her hands were lengthened into feet, and claws<lb/>
long-curving tipped them; snarling jaws deformed<lb/>
the mouth that Jove had kissed. And lest her prayers<lb/>
and piteous words might move some listening God,<lb/>
and give remembrance, speech was so denied,<lb/>
that only from her throat came angry growls,<lb/>
now uttered hoarse and threatening.<lb/>

    
Still remains<lb/>
her understanding, though her body, thus<lb/>
transformed, makes her appear a savage bear.—<lb/>
her sorrows are expressed in many a groan,<lb/>
repeated as she lifts her hands—if we<lb/>
may call them so—repeated as she lifts<lb/>
them towards the stars and skies, ungrateful Jove<lb/>
regarding; but her voice accuses not.<lb/>

    
Afraid to rest in unfrequented woods,<lb/>
she wandered in the fields that once were hers,<lb/>
around her well-known dwelling. Over crags,<lb/>
in terror, she was driven by the cries<lb/>
of hounds; and many a time she fled in fear,<lb/>
a huntress from the hunters, or she hid<lb/>
from savage animals; forgetting her<lb/>
transformed condition. Changed into a bear,<lb/>
she fled affrighted from the bears that haunt<lb/>
the rugged mountains; and she feared and fled<lb/>
the wolves,—although her father was a wolf.<lb/>

    
When thrice five birthdays rounded out the youth<lb/>
of Arcas, offspring of Lycaon's child,<lb/>
he hunted in the forest of his choice;<lb/>
where, hanging with his platted nets the trees<lb/>
of Erymanthian forest, he espied<lb/>
his transformed mother,—but he knew her not;<lb/>
no one had told him of his parentage.<lb/>

    
Knowing her child, she stood with levelled gaze,<lb/>
amazed and mute as he began approach;<lb/>
but Arcas, frightened at the sight drew back<lb/>
to pierce his mother's breast with wounding spear.—<lb/>
but not permitting it the god of Heaven<lb/>
averted, and removed them from that crime.<lb/>
He, in a mighty wind—through vacant space,<lb/>
upbore them to the dome of starry heaven,<lb/>
and fixed them, Constellations, bright amid<lb/>
the starry host.<lb/>

    
Juno on high beheld<lb/>
Calisto crowned with glory—great with rage<lb/>
her bosom heaved. She flew across the sea,<lb/>
to hoary Tethys and to old Oceanus,<lb/>
whom all the Gods revere, and thus to them<lb/>
in answer to their words she made address;<lb/>

“And is it wondered that the Queen of Gods<lb/>
comes hither from ethereal abodes?<lb/>
My rival sits upon the Throne of Heaven:<lb/>
yea, when the wing of Night has darkened<lb/>
let my fair word be deemed of no repute,<lb/>
if you behold not in the height of Heaven<lb/>
those new made stars, now honoured to my shame,<lb/>
conspicuous; fixed in the highest dome of space<lb/>
that circles the utmost axis of the world.<lb/>

“Who, then, should hesitate to put affront<lb/>
on Juno? matchless goddess! each offense<lb/>
redounds in benefit! Who dreads her rage?<lb/>
Oh boundless powers! Oh unimagined deeds!<lb/>
My enemy assumes a goddess' form<lb/>
when my decree deprives her human shape;—<lb/>
and thus the guilty rue their chastisement!<lb/>

“Now let high Jove to human shape transform<lb/>
this hideous beast, as once before he changed<lb/>
his Io from a heifer.—Let him now<lb/>
divorce his Juno and consort with her,<lb/>
and lead Calisto to his couch, and take<lb/>
that wolf, Lycaon, for a father-in-law!<lb/>

“Oh, if an injury to me, your child,<lb/>
may move your pity! drive the Seven Stars<lb/>
from waters crystalline and azure-tint,<lb/>
and your domain debar from those that shine<lb/>
in Heaven, rewarded for Jove's wickedness.—<lb/>
bathe not a concubine in waters pure.”—<lb/>


Corvus. Coronis. Cornix. Ocyroe.

the Gods of Ocean granted her request.<lb/>

CORONIS AND PHOEBUS

High in her graceful chariot through the air,<lb/>
translucent, wends the goddess, glorious child<lb/>
of Saturn, with her peacocks many-hued:<lb/>
her peacocks, by the death of Argus limped,<lb/>
so gay were made when black as midnight turned<lb/>
thy wings, O chattering raven! white of yore.<lb/>
For, long ago the ravens were not black—<lb/>
their plumage then was white as any dove—<lb/>
white-feathered, snow-white as the geese that guard<lb/>
with watchful cries the Capitol: as white<lb/>
as swans that haunt the streams. Disgrace reversed<lb/>
the raven's hue from white to black, because<lb/>
offense was given by his chattering tongue.<lb/>

    
O glorious Phoebus! dutiful to thee,<lb/>
Coronis of Larissa, fairest maid<lb/>
of all Aemonia, was a grateful charm,<lb/>
a joy to thee whilst faithful to thy love,—<lb/>
while none defamed her chastity. But when<lb/>
the Raven, bird of Phoebus, learned the Nymph<lb/>
had been unfaithful, mischief-bent that bird,<lb/>
spreading his white wings, hastened to impart<lb/>
the sad news to his master. After him<lb/>
the prattling Crow followed with flapping wings,<lb/>
eager to learn what caused the Raven's haste.<lb/>

    
Concealing nothing, with his busy tongue<lb/>
the Raven gave the scandal to that bird:<lb/>
and unto him the prattling Crow replied;<lb/>

“A fruitless errand has befooled thy wits!<lb/>
Take timely warning of my fateful cries:<lb/>
consider what I was and what I am:<lb/>
was justice done? 'Twas my fidelity<lb/>
that caused my downfall. For, it came to pass,<lb/>
within a basket, fashioned of small twigs,<lb/>
Minerva had enclosed that spawn; begot<lb/>
without a mother, Ericthonius;<lb/>
which to the wardship of three virgins, born<lb/>
of double-natured Cecrops, she consigned<lb/>
with this injunction, ‘Look ye not therein,<lb/>
nor learn the secret.’—<lb/>
“But I saw their deeds<lb/>
while hidden in the leaves of a great tree<lb/>
two of the sisters, Herse and Pandrosos,<lb/>
observed the charge, but scoffing at their fears,<lb/>
the third, Aglauros, with her nimble hands<lb/>
untied the knotted cords, and there disclosed<lb/>
a serpent and an infant. This I told<lb/>
Minerva; but in turn, she took away<lb/>
her long protection, and degraded me<lb/>
beneath the boding Owl.—My punishment<lb/>
should warn the birds how many dangers they<lb/>
incur from chattering tongues.<lb/>

“Not my desire<lb/>
impelled me to report to her, nor did<lb/>
I crave protection; which, if thou wilt ask<lb/>
Minerva, though enraged she must confirm.<lb/>
And when is told to thee what lately fame<lb/>
established, thou wilt not despise the Crow. <lb/>

“Begot by Coronaeus, who was lord<lb/>
of all the land of Phocis, I was once<lb/>
a royal virgin, sought by suitors rich<lb/>
and powerful. But beauty proved the cause<lb/>
of my misfortune; for it came to pass,<lb/>
as I was slowly walking on the sands<lb/>
that skirt the merge of ocean, where was oft<lb/>
my wont to roam, the god of Ocean gazed<lb/>
impassioned, and with honied words implored<lb/>
my love—but finding that I paid no heed,<lb/>
and all his words despised, he fumed with rage<lb/>
and followed me.<lb/>

“I fled from that sea-shore,<lb/>
to fields of shifting sands that all my steps<lb/>
delayed: and in despair upon the Gods<lb/>
and all mankind I called for aid, but I<lb/>
was quite alone and helpless. Presently<lb/>
the chaste Minerva, me, a virgin, heard<lb/>
and me assistance gave: for as my arms<lb/>
implored the Heavens, downy feathers grew<lb/>
from out the flesh; and as I tried to cast<lb/>
my mantle from my shoulders, wings appeared<lb/>
upon my tender sides; and as I strove<lb/>
to beat my naked bosom with my hands,<lb/>
nor hands remained nor naked breast to beat.<lb/>

“I ran, and as I sped the sands no more<lb/>
delayed me; I was soaring from the ground;<lb/>
and as I winged the air, Minerva chose<lb/>
me for a life-companion; but alas,<lb/>
although my life was blameless, fate or chance<lb/>
deprived me of Minerva's loving aid;<lb/>
for soon Nictimene succeeded me<lb/>
to her protection and deserved esteem.—<lb/>
it happened in this way,—Nictimene<lb/>
committed the most wicked crimes, for which<lb/>
Minerva changed her to the bird of night—<lb/>
and ever since has claimed her as her own<lb/>
instead of me; and this despite the deed<lb/>
for which she shuns the glorious light of day,<lb/>
and conscious of her crime conceals her shame<lb/>
in the dark night—Minerva's Owl now called.<lb/>
All the glad birds of day, indignant shun,<lb/>
and chase her from the skies.”<lb/>

    
But now replied<lb/>
the Raven to the Crow, that talked so much,<lb/>
“A mischief fall upon your prating head<lb/>
for this detention of my flight. Your words<lb/>
and warnings I despise.” With which retort<lb/>
he winged upon his journey, swiftly thence<lb/>
in haste, despite the warning to inform<lb/>
his patron, Phoebus, how he saw the fair<lb/>
Coronis with a lad of Thessaly.<lb/>

    
And when Apollo, Phoebus, heard the tale<lb/>
the busy Raven made such haste to tell,<lb/>
he dropped his plectrum and his laurel wreath,<lb/>
and his bright countenance went white with rage.<lb/>
He seized his trusted arms, and having bent<lb/>
his certain bow, pierced with a deadly shaft<lb/>
that bosom which so often he had pressed<lb/>
against his own.<lb/>

    
Coronis moaned in pain,—<lb/>
and as she drew the keen shaft from the wound,<lb/>
her snow-white limbs were bathed in purple blood:<lb/>
and thus she wailed, “Ah, Phoebus! punishment<lb/>
is justly mine! but wherefore didst thou not<lb/>
await the hour of birth? for by my death<lb/>
an innocent is slain.” This said, her soul<lb/>
expired with her life-blood, and death congealed<lb/>
her drooping form.<lb/>

    
Sadly the love-lore God<lb/>
repents his jealous deed; regrets too late<lb/>
his ready credence to the Raven's tale.<lb/>
Mourning his thoughtless deed, blaming himself,<lb/>
he vents his rage upon the talking bird;<lb/>
he hates his bow, the string, his own right hand,<lb/>
the fateful arrow. As a last resource,<lb/>
and thus to overcome her destiny,<lb/>
he strove to cherish her beloved form;<lb/>
for vain were all his medicinal arts.<lb/>

    
But when he saw upraised the funeral pyre,<lb/>
where wreathed in flames her body should be burnt,<lb/>
the sorrow of his heart welled forth in sighs;<lb/>
but tearless orbed, for no celestial face<lb/>
may tide of woe bedew. So grieves the poor dam,<lb/>
when, swinging from his right the flashing ax,<lb/>
the butcher with a sounding blow divides<lb/>
the hollow temples of her sucking calf.<lb/>

    
Yet, after Phoebus poured the fragrant myrrh,<lb/>
sweet perfumes on her breast, that now once more<lb/>
against his own he pressed, and after all<lb/>
the prematurely hastened rites were done,<lb/>
he would not suffer the offspring of his loins<lb/>
to mingle with her ashes, but he plucked<lb/>
from out the flames, forth from the mother's thighs<lb/>
his child, unborn, and carried to the cave<lb/>
of double-natured Chiron.<lb/>

    
Then to him<lb/>
he called the silly raven, high in hopes<lb/>
of large requital due for all his words;<lb/>
but, angry with his meddling ways, the God<lb/>
turned the white feathers of that bird to black<lb/>
and then forbade forever more to perch<lb/>
among the favoured birds whose plumes are white.<lb/>


OCYROE AND AESCULAPIUS

Chiron, the Centaur, taught his pupil; proud<lb/>
that he was honoured by that God-like charge.<lb/>
Behold, his lovely daughter, who was born<lb/>
beside the margin of a rapid stream,<lb/>
came forward, with her yellow hair as gold<lb/>
adown her shoulders.—She was known by name<lb/>
Ocyroe. The hidden things that Fate<lb/>
conceals, she had the power to tell; for not<lb/>
content was she to learn her father's arts,<lb/>
but rather pondered on mysterious things.<lb/>

    
So, when the god of Frenzy warmed her breast,<lb/>
gazing on Aesculapius,—the child<lb/>
of Phoebus and Coronis, while her soul<lb/>
was gifted, with prophetic voice she said;<lb/>

“O thou who wilt bestow on all the world<lb/>
the blessed boon of health, increase in strength!<lb/>
To thee shall mortals often owe their lives:<lb/>
to thee is given the power to raise the dead.<lb/>
But when against the power of Deities<lb/>
thou shalt presume to dare thy mortal skill,<lb/>
the bolts of Jove will shatter thy great might,<lb/>
and health no more be thine from thence to grant.<lb/>
And from a god thou shalt return to dust,<lb/>
and once again from dust become a God;<lb/>
and thou shalt thus renew thy destiny.—<lb/>

“And thou, dear father Chiron, brought to birth<lb/>
with pledge of an immortal life, informed<lb/>
with ever-during strength, when biting flames<lb/>
of torment from the baneful serpent's blood<lb/>
are coursing in thy veins, thou shalt implore<lb/>
a welcome death; and thy immortal life<lb/>
the Gods shall suffer to the power of death.—<lb/>
and the three Destinies shall cut thy thread.”<lb/>

    
She would continue these prophetic words<lb/>
but tears unbidden trickled down her face;<lb/>
and, as it seemed her sighs would break her heart,<lb/>
she thus bewailed; “The Fates constrain my speech<lb/>
and I can say no more; my power has gone.<lb/>
Alas, my art, although of little force<lb/>
and doubtful worth, has brought upon my head<lb/>
the wrath of Heaven.<lb/>

“Oh wherefore did I know<lb/>
to cast the future? Now my human form<lb/>
puts on another shape, and the long grass<lb/>
affords me needed nourishment. I want<lb/>
to range the boundless plains and have become,<lb/>
in image of my father's kind, a mare:<lb/>
but gaining this, why lose my human shape?<lb/>
My father's form is one of twain combined.”<lb/>

    
And as she wailed the words became confused<lb/>
and scarcely understood; and soon her speech<lb/>
was only as the whinny of a mare.<lb/>
Down to the meadow's green her arms were stretched;<lb/>
her fingers joined together, and smooth hoofs<lb/>

    
made of five nails a single piece of horn.<lb/>
Her face and neck were lengthened, and her hair<lb/>
swept downward as a tail; the scattered locks<lb/>
that clung around her neck were made a mane,<lb/>
tossed over to the right. Her voice and shape<lb/>
were altogether changed, and since that day<lb/>
the change has given her a different name.<lb/>


Battus.

In vain her hero father, Chiron, prayed<lb/>
the glorious God, Apollo, her to aid.<lb/>
He could not thwart the will of mighty Jove;<lb/>
and if the power were his, far from the spot,<lb/>
from thence afar his footsteps trod the fields<lb/>
of Elis and Messenia, far from thence.<lb/>

BATTUS AND MERCURY

Now while Apollo wandered on those plains,—<lb/>
his shoulders covered with a shepherd's skin,<lb/>
his left hand holding his long shepherd's staff,<lb/>
his right hand busied with the seven reeds<lb/>
of seven sizes, brooding over the death<lb/>
of Hymenaeus, lost from his delight;<lb/>
while mournful ditties on the reeds were tuned,—<lb/>
his kine, forgotten, strayed away to graze<lb/>
over the plains of Pylos. Mercury<lb/>
observed them, unattended, and from thence<lb/>
drove them away and hid them in the forest.<lb/>

    
So deftly did he steal them, no one knew<lb/>
or noticed save an ancient forester,<lb/>
well known to all the neighbor-folk, by them<lb/>
called Battus. He was keeper of that wood,<lb/>
and that green pasture where the blooded mares<lb/>
of rich Neleus grazed.<lb/>

    
As Mercury<lb/>
distrusted him, he led him to one side<lb/>
and said; “Good stranger, whosoever thou art,<lb/>
if any one should haply question thee,<lb/>
if thou hast seen these kine, deny it all;<lb/>
and for thy good will, ere the deed is done,<lb/>
I give as thy reward this handsome cow.”<lb/>

    
Now when the gift was his, old Battus said,<lb/>
“Go hence in safety, if it be thy will;<lb/>
and should my tongue betray thee, let that stone<lb/>
make mention of the theft.” And as he spoke,<lb/>
he pointed to a stone.<lb/>

    
The son of Jove<lb/>
pretended to depart, but quickly changed<lb/>
his voice and features, and retraced his steps,<lb/>
and thus again addressed that ancient man;<lb/>
“Kind sir, if thou wouldst earn a fair reward,<lb/>
a heifer and a bull, if thou hast seen<lb/>
some cattle pass, I pray thee give thy help,<lb/>
and tell me of the theft.” So the reward<lb/>
was doubled; and the old man answered him,<lb/>
“Beyond those hills they be,” and so they were<lb/>
‘Beyond those hills.’<lb/>

    
And, laughing, Mercury said,<lb/>
“Thou treacherous man to me dost thou betray<lb/>
myself? Dost thou bewray me to myself?”<lb/>
The god indignant turned his perjured breast<lb/>
into a stone which even now is called<lb/>
“The Spy of Pylos,” a disgraceful name,<lb/>
derived from days of old, but undeserved.<lb/>


Aglauros. Invidia.
AGLAUROS AND MERCURY

High in the dome of Heaven, behold the bright<lb/>
Caduceus-Bearer soared on balanced wings;<lb/>
and far below him through a fruitful grove,<lb/>
devoted to Minerva's hallowed reign,<lb/>
some virgins bearing on their lovely heads,<lb/>
in wicker baskets wreathed and decked with flowers,<lb/>
their sacred offerings to the citadel<lb/>
of that chaste goddess. And the winged God,<lb/>
while circling in the clear unbounded skies,<lb/>
beheld that train of virgins, beautiful,<lb/>
as they were thence returning on their way.<lb/>

    
Not forward on a level line he flew,<lb/>
but wheeled in circles round. Lo, the swift kite<lb/>
swoops round the smoking entrails, while the priests<lb/>
enclose in guarded ranks their sacrifice:<lb/>
wary with fear, that swiftest of all birds,<lb/>
dares not to venture from his vantage height,<lb/>
but greedily hovers on his waving wings<lb/>
around his keen desire. So, the bright God<lb/>
circled those towers, Actaean, round and round,<lb/>
in mazey circles, greedy as the bird.<lb/>

    
As much as Lucifer outshines the stars<lb/>
that emulate the glory of his rays,<lb/>
as greatly as bright Phoebe pales thy light,<lb/>
O lustrous Lucifer! so far surpassed<lb/>
in beauty the fair maiden Herse, all<lb/>
those lovely virgins of that sacred train,<lb/>
departing joyous from Minerva's grove.<lb/>

    
The Son of Jove, astonished, while he wheeled<lb/>
on balanced pinions through the yielding air,<lb/>
burned hot; as oft from Balearic sling<lb/>
the leaden missile, hurled with sudden force,<lb/>
burns in a glowing heat beneath the clouds.<lb/>

    
Then sloped the god his course from airy height,<lb/>
and turned a different way; another way<lb/>
he went without disguise, in confidence<lb/>
of his celestial grace. But though he knew<lb/>
his face was beautiful, he combed his hair,<lb/>
and fixed his flowing raiment, that the fringe<lb/>
of radiant gold appeared. And in his hand<lb/>
he waved his long smooth wand, with which he gives<lb/>
the wakeful sleep or waketh ridded eyes.<lb/>
He proudly glanced upon his twinkling feet<lb/>
that sparkled with their scintillating wings.<lb/>

    
In a secluded part of that great fane,<lb/>
devoted to Minerva's hallowed rites,<lb/>
three chambers were adorned with tortoise shell<lb/>
and ivory and precious woods inlaid;<lb/>
and there, devoted to Minerva's praise,<lb/>
three well known sisters dwelt. Upon the right<lb/>
dwelt Pandrosos and over on the left<lb/>
Aglauros dwelt, and Herse occupied<lb/>
the room between those two.<lb/>

    
When Mercury<lb/>
drew near to them, Aglauros first espied<lb/>
the God, and ventured to enquire his name,<lb/>
and wherefore he was come. Then gracious spoke<lb/>
to her in answer the bright son of Jove;<lb/>

“Behold the god who carries through the air<lb/>
the mandates of almighty Jupiter!<lb/>
But I come hither not to waste my time<lb/>
in idle words, but rather to beseech<lb/>
thy kindness and good aid, that I may win<lb/>
the love of thy devoted sister Herse.”<lb/>

    
Aglauros, on the son of Jupiter,<lb/>
gazed with those eyes that only lately viewed<lb/>
the guarded secret of the yellow-haired<lb/>
Minerva, and demanded as her price<lb/>
gold of great weight; before he paid denied<lb/>
admittance of the house.<lb/>

    
Minerva turned,<lb/>
with orbs of stern displeasure, towards the maid<lb/>
Aglauros; and her bosom heaved with sighs<lb/>
so deeply laboured that her Aegis-shield<lb/>
was shaken on her valiant breast. For she<lb/>
remembered when Aglauros gave to view<lb/>
her charge, with impious hand, that monster form<lb/>
without a mother, maugre Nature's law,<lb/>
what time the god who dwells on Lemnos loved.—<lb/>

    
now to requite the god and sister; her<lb/>
to punish whose demand of gold was great;<lb/>
Minerva to the Cave of Envy sped.<lb/>
Dark, hideous with black gore, her dread abode<lb/>
is hidden in the deepest hollowed cave,<lb/>
in utmost limits where the genial sun<lb/>
may never shine, and where the breathing winds<lb/>
may never venture; dismal, bitter cold,<lb/>
untempered by the warmth of welcome fires,<lb/>
involved forever in abounding gloom.<lb/>

    
When the fair champion came to this abode<lb/>
she stood before its entrance, for she deemed<lb/>
it not a lawful thing to enter there:<lb/>
and she whose arm is mortal to her foes,<lb/>
struck the black door-posts with her pointed spear,<lb/>
and shook them to the center. Straight the doors<lb/>
flew open, and, behold, within was Envy<lb/>
ravening the flesh of vipers, self-begot,<lb/>
the nutriment of her depraved desires.—<lb/>

    
when the great goddess met her evil gaze<lb/>
she turned her eyes away. But Envy slow,<lb/>
in sluggish languor from the ground uprose,<lb/>
and left the scattered serpents half-devoured;<lb/>
then moving with a sullen pace approached.—<lb/>
and when she saw the gracious goddess, girt<lb/>
with beauty and resplendent in her arms,<lb/>
she groaned aloud and fetched up heavy sighs.<lb/>

    
Her face is pale, her body long and lean,<lb/>
her shifting eyes glance to the left and right,<lb/>
her snaggle teeth are covered with black rust,<lb/>
her hanging paps overflow with bitter gall,<lb/>
her slavered tongue drips venom to the ground;<lb/>
busy in schemes and watchful in dark snares<lb/>
sweet sleep is banished from her blood-shot eyes;<lb/>
her smiles are only seen when others weep;<lb/>
with sorrow she observes the fortunate,<lb/>
and pines away as she beholds their joy;<lb/>
her own existence is her punishment,<lb/>
and while tormenting she torments herself.<lb/>

    
Although Minerva held her in deep scorn<lb/>
she thus commanded her with winged words;<lb/>
“Instil thy poison in Aglauros, child<lb/>
of Cecrops; I command thee; do my will.”<lb/>

    
She spake; and spurning with her spear the ground<lb/>
departed; and the sad and furtive-eyed<lb/>
envy observed her in her glorious flight:<lb/>
she murmured at the goddess, great in arms:<lb/>
but waiting not she took in hand her staff,<lb/>
which bands of thorns encircled as a wreath,<lb/>
and veiled in midnight clouds departed thence.<lb/>
She blasted on her way the ripening fields;<lb/>
scorched the green meadows, starred with flowers,<lb/>
and breathed a pestilence throughout the land<lb/>
and the great cities. When her eyes beheld<lb/>
the glorious citadel of Athens, great<lb/>
in art and wealth, abode of joyful peace,<lb/>
she hardly could refrain from shedding tears,<lb/>
that nothing might be witnessed worthy tears.<lb/>

    
She sought the chamber where Aglauros slept,<lb/>
and hastened to obey the God's behest.<lb/>
She touched the maiden's bosom with her hands,<lb/>
foul with corrupting stains, and pierced her heart<lb/>
with jagged thorns, and breathed upon her face<lb/>
a noxious venom; and distilled through all<lb/>
the marrow of her bones, and in her lungs,<lb/>
a poison blacker than the ooze of pitch.<lb/>

    
And lest the canker of her poisoned soul<lb/>
might spread unchecked throughout increasing space,<lb/>
she caused a vision of her sister's form<lb/>
to rise before her, happy with the God<lb/>
who shone in his celestial beauty. All<lb/>
appeared more beautiful than real life.—<lb/>

    
when the most wretched daughter of Cecrops<lb/>
had seen the vision secret torment seized<lb/>
on all her vitals; and she groaned aloud,<lb/>
tormented by her frenzy day and night.<lb/>

    
A slow consumption wasted her away,<lb/>
as ice is melted by the slant sunbeam,<lb/>
when the cool clouds are flitting in the sky.<lb/>
If she but thought of Herse's happiness<lb/>
she burned, as thorny bushes are consumed<lb/>
with smoldering embers under steaming stems.<lb/>
She could not bear to see her sister's joy,<lb/>
and longed for death, an end of misery;<lb/>
or schemed to end the torture of her mind<lb/>
by telling all she knew in shameful words,<lb/>
whispered to her austere and upright sire.<lb/>

    
But after many agonizing hours,<lb/>
she sat before the threshold of their home<lb/>
to intercept the God, who as he neared<lb/>
spoke softly in smooth blandishment.<lb/>
“Enough,” she said, “I will not move from here<lb/>
until thou hast departed from my sight.”<lb/>
“Let us adhere to that which was agreed.”<lb/>
Rejoined the graceful-formed Cyllenian God,<lb/>
who as he spoke thrust open with a touch<lb/>
of his compelling wand the carved door.<lb/>

    
But when she made an effort to arise,<lb/>
her thighs felt heavy, rigid and benumbed;<lb/>
and as she struggled to arise her knees<lb/>
were stiffened? and her nails turned pale and cold;<lb/>
her veins grew pallid as the blood congealed.<lb/>
And even as the dreaded cancer spreads<lb/>
through all the body, adding to its taint<lb/>
the flesh uninjured; so, a deadly chill<lb/>
entered by slow degrees her breast, and stopped<lb/>
her breathing, and the passages of life.<lb/>
She did not try to speak, but had she made<lb/>
an effort to complain there was not left<lb/>
a passage for her voice. Her neck was changed<lb/>
to rigid stone, her countenance felt hard;<lb/>
she sat a bloodless statue, but of stone<lb/>
not marble-white—her mind had stained it black.<lb/>


Europa.

So from the land of Pallas went the God,<lb/>
his great revenge accomplished on the head<lb/>
of impious Aglauros; and he soared<lb/>
on waving wings into the opened skies:<lb/>
and there his father called him to his side,<lb/>
and said,—with words to hide his passion;—Son,—<lb/>
thou faithful minister of my commands.—<lb/>
let naught delay thee—swiftly take the way,<lb/>
accustomed, to the land of Sidon (which<lb/>
adores thy mother's star upon the left)<lb/>
when there, drive over to the sounding shore<lb/>
that royal herd, which far away is fed<lb/>
on mountain grass.—<lb/>

    
he spoke, and instantly<lb/>
the herd was driven from the mountain side;<lb/>
then headed for the shore, as Jove desired,—<lb/>
to where the great king's daughter often went<lb/>
in play, attended by the maids of Tyre.—<lb/>
can love abide the majesty of kings?<lb/>
Love cannot always dwell upon a throne.—<lb/>

EUROPA AND JUPITERTHE HOUSE OF CADMUS

Jove laid aside his glorious dignity,<lb/>
for he assumed the semblance of a bull<lb/>
and mingled with the bullocks in the groves,<lb/>
his colour white as virgin snow, untrod,<lb/>
unmelted by the watery Southern Wind.<lb/>

    
His neck was thick with muscles, dewlaps hung<lb/>
between his shoulders; and his polished horns,<lb/>
so small and beautifully set, appeared<lb/>
the artifice of man; fashioned as fair<lb/>
and more transparent than a lucent gem.<lb/>
His forehead was not lowered for attack,<lb/>
nor was there fury in his open eyes;<lb/>
the love of peace was in his countenance.<lb/>

    
When she beheld his beauty and mild eyes,<lb/>
the daughter of Agenor was amazed;<lb/>
but, daring not to touch him, stood apart<lb/>
until her virgin fears were quieted;<lb/>
then, near him, fragrant flowers in her hand<lb/>
she offered,—tempting, to his gentle mouth:<lb/>
and then the loving god in his great joy<lb/>
kissed her sweet hands, and could not wait her will.<lb/>

    
Jove then began to frisk upon the grass,<lb/>
or laid his snow-white side on the smooth sand,<lb/>
yellow and golden. As her courage grew<lb/>
he gave his breast one moment for caress,<lb/>
or bent his head for garlands newly made,<lb/>
wreathed for his polished horns.<lb/>

    
The royal maid,<lb/>
unwitting what she did, at length sat down<lb/>
upon the bull's broad back. Then by degrees<lb/>
the god moved from the land and from the shore,<lb/>
and placed his feet, that seemed but shining hoofs,<lb/>
in shallow water by the sandy merge;<lb/>
and not a moment resting bore her thence,<lb/>
across the surface of the Middle Sea,<lb/>
while she affrighted gazed upon the shore—<lb/>
so fast receding. And she held his horn<lb/>
with her right hand, and, steadied by the left,<lb/>
held on his ample back—and in the breeze<lb/>
her waving garments fluttered as they went.<lb/>

Armorum iudicium. Aiax.
AJAX AND ULYSSES

<l>The chiefs were seated, and the soldiers form</l>
<l>a circle round them. Then Ajax, the approved</l>
<l>lord of the seven-fold shield, arose and spoke.</l>
<l>Impatient in his wrath, he looked with stern,</l>
<l>set features, out over Sigaean shores,</l>
<l>and over the fleet of ships upon the beach,</l>
<l>and, stretching out his hands, he said,</l>

    
<l>“We plead,</l>
<l>O Jupiter, our cause before the ships,—</l>
<l>Ulysses vies with me! He did not shrink</l>
<l>from giving way before the flames of Hector,</l>
<l>when I withstood them and I saved the fleet.</l>
<l>'Tis safer then to fight with lying words</l>
<l>than with his hands. I am not prompt to speak,</l>
<l>nor he to act. I am as good in war</l>
<l>and deadly battle as he is in talk.</l>
<l>Pelasgians, I do not suppose my deeds</l>
<l>must here be mentioned: you have witnessed them</l>
<l>but let Ulysses tell of deeds which he</l>
<l>performed without a witness and which Night</l>
<l>alone is conscious of. I own the prize</l>
<l>we seek is great, but such a rival makes</l>
<l>it small. To Ajax there s no cause for pride</l>
<l>in having any prize, however great,</l>
<l>for which Ulysses hoped. But he has won</l>
<l>reward enough already. He can boast,</l>
<l>when vanquished, that he strove with me.</l>

    
<l>“I, even if my merit were in doubt</l>
<l>should still excell in birth. I am the son</l>
<l>of Telamon, who with great Hercules</l>
<l>brought low the power of Troy and in the ship</l>
<l>of Jason voyaged even to the Colchian shores.</l>
<l>His father, Aeacus, now is a judge</l>
<l>among the silent shades—where Sisyphus</l>
<l>toils and is mocked forever with the stone.</l>
<l>Great Jove himself calls Aeacus his son.</l>
<l>Thus, Ajax is the third from Jupiter.</l>
<l>But, Greeks, let not this line of my descent</l>
<l>avail me, if I do not share it with</l>
<l>my cousin, great Achilles. I demand</l>
<l>these arms now due me as a cousin. Why</l>
<l>should this one, from the blood of Sisyphus,</l>
<l>and like him for his thefts and frauds, intrude</l>
<l>the names of that loathed family upon</l>
<l>honored descendants of brave Aeacus?</l>

    
<l>“Will you deny me arms because I took</l>
<l>arms earlier, no man prompting me,</l>
<l>and call this man the better, who last of all</l>
<l>took up arms, and, pretending he was mad,</l>
<l>declined war, till the son of Naplius</l>
<l>more shrewd than he (but to his future cost)</l>
<l>discovered the contrivance of the fraud</l>
<l>and had the coward dragged forth to the arms</l>
<l>he had avoided. And shall this man have</l>
<l>the world's best arms, who wanted none?</l>
<l>Shall I lack honor and my cousin's gift</l>
<l>because I faced the danger with the first?</l>

    
<l>“Would that his madness had been real, or</l>
<l>had been accepted as reality</l>
<l>and that he never had attended us,</l>
<l>as our companion to the Phrygian towers,</l>
<l>this counsellor of evil! Then, good son</l>
<l>of Poeas, Lemnos would not hold you now,</l>
<l>exposed through guilt of ours! You, as men say,</l>
<l>hidden in forest lairs, are moving with your groans</l>
<l>the very rocks and asking for Ulysses</l>
<l>what he so well deserves—what, if indeed</l>
<l>there still are gods, you shall not ask in vain.</l>
<l>And now, one of our leaders, he that was</l>
<l>sworn to the same arms with ourselves! by whom</l>
<l>the arrows of great Hercules are used,</l>
<l>as his successor; broken by disease</l>
<l>and famine, clothed with feathers, now must feed</l>
<l>on birds and squander for his wretched fare</l>
<l>the arrows destined for the wreck of Troy.</l>

    
<l>“At least he lives, because he has not stayed</l>
<l>too near Ulysses. Hapless Palamedes</l>
<l>might wish that he too had been left behind,</l>
<l>then he would live or would have met a death</l>
<l>without dishonor. For this man, who well</l>
<l>remembered the unfortunate discovery</l>
<l>of his feigned madness, made a fraudulent</l>
<l>attack on Palamedes, who he said</l>
<l>betrayed the Grecian interest. He proved</l>
<l>his false charge to the Greeks by showing them</l>
<l>the gold which he himself hid in the ground.</l>
<l>By exile or by death he has decreased</l>
<l>the true strength of the Greeks. And so he fights,</l>
<l>for such things men have cause to fear Ulysses!</l>

    
<l>“Should he excel the faithful Nestor by</l>
<l>his eloquence, I'd yet be well convinced</l>
<l>the way he forsook Nestor was a crime,</l>
<l>old Nestor, who implored in vain his aid,</l>
<l>when he was hindered by his wounded steed</l>
<l>and wearied with the years of his old age,</l>
<l>was then deserted by that scheming man.</l>
<l>The charge that I have made is strictly true,</l>
<l>and the son of Tydeus knows it all too well;</l>
<l>for he at that time called him by his name,</l>
<l>rebuked him and upbraided his weak friend</l>
<l>for coward flight.</l>

    
<l>“The gods above behold</l>
<l>the affairs of men with justice. That same man</l>
<l>who would not help a friend now calls for help;</l>
<l>he who forsook a friend, should be forsaken,</l>
<l>the law he made returns upon himself.</l>
<l>He called aloud on his companions;</l>
<l>I came and saw him trembling, pale with fear,</l>
<l>and shuddering, at the thought of coming death.</l>
<l>I held my shield above him where he lay,</l>
<l>and that way saved the villain's dastard life,</l>
<l>and little praise I have deserved for that.</l>
<l>If you still wish to claim this armor, let</l>
<l>us both return to that place and restore</l>
<l>the enemy, your wound, and usual fear—</l>
<l>there hide behind my shield, and under that</l>
<l>contend with me! Yet, when I faced the foe,</l>
<l>he, whom his wound had left no power to stand,</l>
<l>forgot the wound and took to headlong flight.</l>

    
<l>“Hector approached, and brought the gods with him</l>
<l>to battle; and, wherever he rushed on,</l>
<l>not only this Ulysses was alarmed,</l>
<l>but even the valiant, for so great the fear</l>
<l>he caused them. Hector, proud in his success</l>
<l>in blood and slaughter, I then dared to meet</l>
<l>and with a huge: stone from a distance hurled</l>
<l>I laid him flat. When he demanded one</l>
<l>to fight with, I engaged him quite alone,</l>
<l>for you my Greek friends, prayed the lot</l>
<l>might fall upon me, and your prayers prevailed.</l>
<l>If you should ask me of this fight, I will</l>
<l>declare I was not vanquished there by him.</l>

    
<l>“Behold, the Trojans brought forth fire and sword</l>
<l>and Jove, as well, against the Grecian fleet,</l>
<l>where now has eloquent Ulysses gone?</l>
<l>Truly, I did protect a thousand ships</l>
<l>with my breast, saving the hopes of your return.—</l>
<l>for all these many ships, award me arms!</l>
<l>But, let me speak the truth, the arms will gain</l>
<l>more fame than I, for they will share my glory.</l>
<l>And they need Ajax, Ajax needs not them.</l>

<l>Let the Ithacan compare with deeds like mine</l>
<l>his sleeping Rhesus, his unwarlike Dolon,</l>
<l>Helenus taken, and Pallas gained by theft—</l>
<l>all done by night and all with Diomed.</l>
<l>If you must give these arms for deeds so mean,</l>
<l>then give the greater share to Diomed.</l>

    
<l>“Why give arms to Ulysses, who by stealth</l>
<l>and quite unarmed, has always done his work,</l>
<l>deceiving his unwary enemy</l>
<l>by stratagems? This brilliant helmet, rich</l>
<l>with sparkling gold, will certainly betray</l>
<l>his plans, and will discover him when hid.</l>
<l>His soft Dulichian head beneath the helm</l>
<l>of great Achilles will not bear the weight;</l>
<l>Achilles' heavy spear from Pelion must</l>
<l>be burdensome for his unwarlike hands:</l>
<l>nor will the shield, graven with the vasty world</l>
<l>beseem a dastard left hand, smooth for theft.</l>

    
<l>“Why caitiff, will you beg them for a gift,</l>
<l>which will but weaken you? If by mistake,</l>
<l>the Grecian people should award you this,</l>
<l>it would not fright the foe but offer spoils</l>
<l>and that swift flight (in which alone you have</l>
<l>excelled all others, dastard wretch!) would soon</l>
<l>grow laggard, dragging such a weight. And that</l>
<l>good shield of yours, which has but rarely felt</l>
<l>a conflict, is unhurt; for mine, agape</l>
<l>with wounds a thousand from swift-striking darts,</l>
<l>a new one must be found.</l>

    
<l>“In short, what need</l>
<l>is there for words? Let us be tried in war.</l>
<l>Let all the arms of brave Achilles now</l>
<l>be thrown among the foe; order them all</l>
<l>to be retrieved; and decorate for war</l>
<l>whoever brings them back, a worthy prize.”</l>

    
<l>Ajax, the son of Telamon, stopped speech,</l>
<l>and murmuring among the multitude</l>
<l>followed his closing words, until Ulysses,</l>
<l>Laertian hero, stood up there and fixed</l>
<l>his eyes a short time on the ground; then raised</l>
<l>them towards the chiefs; and with his opening words,</l>
<l>which they awaited, the grace of his art</l>
<l>was not found wanting to his eloquence.</l>

    
<l>“If my desire and yours could have prevailed,</l>
<l>O noble Greeks, the man who should receive</l>
<l>a prize so valued, would not be in doubt,</l>
<l>and you would now enjoy your arms, and we</l>
<l>enjoy you, great Achilles. Since unjust</l>
<l>fate has denied him both to me and you,</l>
<l>(and here he wiped his eyes dry with his hands,</l>
<l>as though then shedding tears,) who could succeed</l>
<l>the great Achilles better than the one</l>
<l>through whom the great Achilles joined the Greeks?</l>
<l>Let Ajax win no votes because he seems</l>
<l>to be as stupid as the truth declares.</l>
<l>Let not my talents, which were always used</l>
<l>for service of the Greeks, increase my harm:</l>
<l>and let this eloquence of mine (if such</l>
<l>we call it) which is pleading now for me,</l>
<l>as it has pleaded many times for you,</l>
<l>awake no envy. Let each man show his best.</l>

    
<l>“Now as for ancestors and noble birth</l>
<l>and deeds we have not done ourselves, all these</l>
<l>I hardly call them ours. But, if he boasts</l>
<l>because he is the great grandson of Jove,</l>
<l>the founder of my family, you know,</l>
<l>is Jupiter; by birth I am just the same</l>
<l>degree removed from Jupiter as he.</l>
<l>Laertes is my father, my grandsire is</l>
<l>Arcesius; and my great grandsire is Jove,</l>
<l>and my line: has no banished criminal.</l>
<l>My mother's grandsire, Mercury, would give</l>
<l>me further claims of birth—on either side a god.</l>

    
<l>“But not because my mother's line is better</l>
<l>and not because my father certainly,</l>
<l>is innocent of his own brother's blood,</l>
<l>have I advanced my claim to own those arms.</l>
<l>Let personal merit weigh the cause alone.</l>
<l>Let Ajax win no credit from the fact</l>
<l>that Telamon, was brother unto Peleus.</l>
<l>Let not his merit be that he is near by blood,</l>
<l>may honor of manhood weigh in your award!</l>

    
<l>“But, if you seek the heir and next of kin,</l>
<l>Peleus is father, and Pyrrhus is the son</l>
<l>of great Achilles. Where is Ajax then?</l>
<l>These arms might go to Phthia or to Scyros!</l>
<l>Teucer might claim the prize because he is</l>
<l>Achilles' cousin. Does he seek these arms?</l>
<l>And, if he did, would you allow his claim?</l>

    
<l>“Since then the contest lies in deeds alone,</l>
<l>though I have done more than may be well told,</l>
<l>I will recall them as they have occurred.</l>

    
<l>“Achilles' Nereid mother, who foresaw</l>
<l>his death, concealed her son by change of dress.</l>
<l>By that disguise Ajax, among the rest,</l>
<l>was well deceived. I showed with women's wares</l>
<l>arms that might win the spirit of a man.</l>
<l>The hero still wore clothing of a girl,</l>
<l>when, as he held a shield and spear, I said</l>
<l>‘Son of a goddess! Pergama but waits</l>
<l>to fall by you, why do you hesitate</l>
<l>to assure the overthrow of mighty Troy?’</l>
<l>With these bold words, I laid my hand on him—</l>
<l>and to: brave actions I sent forth the brave:</l>
<l>his deeds of Bravery are therefore mine</l>
<l>it was my power that conquered Telephus,</l>
<l>as he fought with his lance; it was through me</l>
<l>that, vanquished and suppliant? he at last was healed.</l>
<l>I caused the fall of Thebes; believe me, I</l>
<l>took Lesbos, Tenedos, Chryse and Cilla—</l>
<l>the cities of Apollo; and I took</l>
<l>Scyros; think too, of the Lyrnesian wall</l>
<l>as shaken by my hand, destroyed, and thrown </l>
<l>down level with the ground. Let this suffice:</l>
<l>I found the man who caused fierce Hector's death,</l>
<l>through me the famous Hector now, lies low!</l>
<l>And for those arms which made Achilles known</l>
<l>I now demand these arms. To him alive</l>
<l>I gave them—at his death they should be mine.</l>

    
<l>“After the grief of one had reached all Greece,</l>
<l>and ships a thousand, filled Euboean Aulis;</l>
<l>the breezes long expected would not blow</l>
<l>or adverse held the helpless fleet ashore.</l>
<l>Then ruthless oracles gave their command,</l>
<l>that Agamemnon should make sacrifice</l>
<l>of his loved daughter and so satisfy</l>
<l>Diana's cruel heart. The father stood</l>
<l>up resolute, enraged against the gods,</l>
<l>a parent even though a king. I turned,</l>
<l>by tactful! words, a father's tender heart</l>
<l>to the great issue of the public weal.</l>
<l>I will confess it, and when I have confessed,</l>
<l>may the son of Atreus pardon: I had to plead</l>
<l>a difficult case before a partial judge.</l>
<l>The people's good, his brother's, and stern duty,</l>
<l>that followed his great office, won his ear,</l>
<l>till royal honor outweighed claims of blood.</l>
<l>I sought the mother, who could not be won</l>
<l>by pleading but must be deceived by craft.</l>
<l>Had Ajax gone to her, our thousand sails</l>
<l>would still droop, waiting for the favoring breeze.</l>

    
<l>“As a bold envoy I was even sent</l>
<l>off to the towers of Ilium, and there</l>
<l>I saw the senate-house of lofty Troy,</l>
<l>and, fearless, entered it, while it was full</l>
<l>of heroes. There, undaunted, I spoke for</l>
<l>the cause which all the Greeks had given me.</l>
<l>Accusing Paris, I demanded back</l>
<l>the gold and stolen Helen, and I moved</l>
<l>both Priam and Antenor. All the while</l>
<l>Paris, his brothers, and their robber crew</l>
<l>could scarce withhold their wicked hands from me.</l>
<l>And all this, Menelaus, is well known to you:</l>
<l>that was the first danger I shared with you.</l>


    
<l>“I need not linger over the many things</l>
<l>which by my counsel and my bravery</l>
<l>I have accomplished through this long-drawn war.</l>

    
<l>“A long time, after the first battle clash,</l>
<l>the foe lay quiet within city walls,</l>
<l>giving no challenge for an open fight—</l>
<l>he stood nine years of siege before we fought</l>
<l>what were you doing all that tedious time,</l>
<l>what use were you, good only in a fight?</l>
<l>If you will make inquiry of my deeds:</l>
<l>I fashioned ambuscades for enemies;</l>
<l>and circled our defenses with a trench;</l>
<l>I cheered allies so they might all endure</l>
<l>with patient minds a long, protracted war;</l>
<l>I showed how our own army might subsist</l>
<l>and how it could be armed; and I was sent</l>
<l>wherever the necessity required.</l>

    
<l>“Then, at the wish of Jove, our king, deceive</l>
<l>by A false dream, bids us give up the war—</l>
<l>he could excuse his order by the cause.</l>
<l>Let Ajax tell him Troy must be laid low</l>
<l>or let him fight—at least he can do that!</l>
<l>Why does he fail to stop the fugitives?</l>
<l>Why not take arms and tell the wavering crowd</l>
<l>to rally round him? Would that be too much</l>
<l>for one who never speaks except to boast?</l>
<l>But now words fail me: Ajax turns and flees!</l>
<l>I witnessed it and was ashamed to see</l>
<l>you turn disgraced, preparing sails for flight.</l>
<l>With exclamations and without delay,</l>
<l>I said, ‘What are you doing? O my friends,</l>
<l>has madness seized you that you will quit Troy,</l>
<l>which is as good as taken? What can you</l>
<l>bear home, after ten years, but your disgrace?’</l>

    
<l>“With these commanding words, which grief itself</l>
<l>gave eloquence, I brought resisting Greeks</l>
<l>back from their purposed flight. Atrides called</l>
<l>together his allies, all terror struck.</l>
<l>Even then, Ajax the son of Telamon</l>
<l>dared not vouchsafe one word. But impudent</l>
<l>Thersites hurled vile words against the kings,</l>
<l>and, thanks to me, he did not miss reproof.</l>
<l>I rose and spoke to my disheartened friends,</l>
<l>reviving their lost courage with my words</l>
<l>from that time forth, whatever deeds this man,</l>
<l>my rival, may have done, belong to me.</l>
<l>'Twas I who stayed his flight and brought him back.</l>

    
<l>“Which of the noble Greeks has given you praise</l>
<l>or sought your company? Yet Diomed</l>
<l>has shared his deeds with me and praises me,</l>
<l>and, while Ulysses is with him, is brave</l>
<l>and confident. 'Tis worthy of regard,</l>
<l>when out of many thousands of the Greeks,</l>
<l>a man becomes the choice of Diomed!</l>

    
<l>“It was not lot that ordered me to go;</l>
<l>and yet, despising dangers of the night,</l>
<l>despising dangers of the enemy,</l>
<l>I slew one, Dolon, of the Phrygian race,</l>
<l>who dared to do the very things we dared,</l>
<l>but not before I had prevailed on him</l>
<l>to tell me everything, by which I learned</l>
<l>perfidious actions which Troy had designed.</l>

    
<l>“Of such things now, I had discovered all</l>
<l>that should be found out, and I might have then</l>
<l>returned to enjoy the praise I had deserved.</l>
<l>But not content with that, I sought the tent</l>
<l>of Rhesus, and within his camp I slew</l>
<l>him and his proved attendants. Having thus</l>
<l>gained as a conqueror my own desires,</l>
<l>I drove back in a captured chariot,—</l>
<l>a joyous triumph. Well, deny me, then.</l>
<l>The arms of him whose steeds the enemy</l>
<l>demanded as the price of one night's aid.</l>
<l>Ajax himself has been more generous.</l>

    
<l>“Why should I name Sarpedon's Lycian troops</l>
<l>among whom I made havoc with my sword?</l>
<l>I left Coeranos dead and streaming blood,</l>
<l>with the sword I killed Alastor, Chromius,</l>
<l>Alcander, Prytanis, Halius, and Noemon,</l>
<l>Thoon and Charops with Chersidamas,</l>
<l>and Ennomus—all driven by cruel fate,</l>
<l>not reckoning humbler men whom I laid low,</l>
<l>battling beneath the shadow of the city walls.</l>
<l>And fellow citizens, I have my wounds</l>
<l>honorable in the front. Do not believe</l>
<l>my word alone. Look for yourselves and see!”</l>
<l>Then with one hand, he drew his robe aside.</l>
<l>“Here is a breast,” he cried, “that bled for you!</l>
<l>But Ajax never shed a drop of blood</l>
<l>to aid his friends, in all these many years,</l>
<l>and has a body free of any wound.</l>

    
<l>“What does it prove, if he declares that he</l>
<l>fought for our ships against both Troy and Jove?</l>
<l>I grant he did, for it is not my wont</l>
<l>with malice to belittle other's deeds.</l>
<l>But let him not claim for himself alone</l>
<l>an honor in which all may have a share,</l>
<l>let him concede some credit due to you.</l>
<l>Disguised within the fear inspiring arms</l>
<l>of great Achilles, Actor's son drove back</l>
<l>the host of Trojans from our threatened fleet</l>
<l>or ships and Ajax would have burned together.</l>

    
<l>“Unmindful of the king, the chiefs, and me,</l>
<l>he dreams that he alone dared to engage</l>
<l>in single fight with Hector—he the ninth</l>
<l>to volunteer and chosen just by lot.</l>
<l>But yet, O brave chief! What availed the fight?</l>
<l>Hector returned, not injured by a wound.</l>

    
<l>“Ah, bitter fate, with how much grief I am</l>
<l>compelled to recollect the time, when brave</l>
<l>Achilles, bulwark of the Greeks, was slain.</l>
<l>Nor tears, nor grief, nor fear, could hinder me:</l>
<l>I carried his dead body from the ground,</l>
<l>uplifted on these shoulders, I repeat,</l>
<l>upon these shoulders from that ground</l>
<l>I bore off dead Achilles, and those arms</l>
<l>which now I want to bear away again.</l>
<l>I have the strength to walk beneath their weight,</l>
<l>I have a mind to understand their worth.</l>
<l>Did the hero's mother, goddess of the sea,</l>
<l>win for her son these arms, made by a god,</l>
<l>a work of wondrous art, to have them clothe</l>
<l>a rude soldier, who has no mind at all?</l>
<l>He never could be made to understand</l>
<l>the rich engravings, pictured on the shield—</l>
<l>the ocean, earth, and stars in lofty skies;</l>
<l>the Pleiades, and Hyades, the Bear,</l>
<l>which touches not the ocean, far beyond</l>
<l>the varied planets, and the fire-bright sword</l>
<l>of high Orion. He demands a prize,</l>
<l>which, if he had it, would be lost on him.</l>

    
<l>“What of his taunting me, because I shrank</l>
<l>from hardships of this war and I was slow</l>
<l>to join the expedition? Does he not see,</l>
<l>that he reviles the great Achilles too?</l>
<l>Was my pretense a crime? then so was his.</l>
<l>Was our delay a fault? mine was the less,</l>
<l>for I came sooner; me a loving wife</l>
<l>detained from war, a loving mother him.</l>
<l>Some hours we gave to them, the rest to you.</l>
<l>Why should I be alarmed, if now I am</l>
<l>unable to defend myself against</l>
<l>this accusation, which is just the same</l>
<l>as you have brought against so great a man?</l>
<l>Yet he was found by the dexterity</l>
<l>of me, Ulysses, and Ulysses was</l>
<l>not found by the dexterity of Ajax.</l>

    
<l>“It is no wonder that he pours on me</l>
<l>reproaches of his silly tongue, because</l>
<l>he charges you with what is worthy shame.</l>
<l>Am I depraved because this Palamedes has</l>
<l>improperly been charged with crime by me?</l>
<l>Then was it honorable for all of you,</l>
<l>if you condemned him? Only think, that he,</l>
<l>the son of Naplius, made no defence</l>
<l>against the crime, so great, so manifest:</l>
<l>nor did you only hear the charges brought</l>
<l>against him, but you saw the proof yourselves,</l>
<l>and in the gold his villainy was shown.</l>


    
<l>“Nor am I to be blamed, if Vulcan's isle</l>
<l>of Lemnos has become the residence</l>
<l>of Philoctetes. Greeks, defend yourselves,</l>
<l>for you agreed to it! Yes, I admit</l>
<l>I urged him to withdraw from toils of war</l>
<l>and those of travel and attempt by rest</l>
<l>to ease his cruel pain. He took my advice</l>
<l>and lives! The advice was not alone well meant</l>
<l>(that would have been enough) but it was wise.</l>
<l>Because our prophets have declared, he must</l>
<l>lead us, if we may still maintain our hope</l>
<l>for Troy's destruction—therefore, you must not</l>
<l>intrust that work to me. Much better, send</l>
<l>the son of Telamon. His eloquence</l>
<l>will overcome the hero's rage, most fierce</l>
<l>from his disease and anger: or else his</l>
<l>invention of some wile will skilfully</l>
<l>deliver him to us.—The Simois</l>
<l>will first flow backward, Ida stand without</l>
<l>its foliage, and Achaia promise aid</l>
<l>to Troy itself; ere, lacking aid from me,</l>
<l>the craft of stupid Ajax will avail.</l>

    
<l>“Though, Philoctetes, you should be enraged</l>
<l>against your friends, against the king and me;</l>
<l>although you curse and everlastingly</l>
<l>devote my head to harm; although you wish,</l>
<l>to ease your anguish, that I may be given</l>
<l>into your power, that you may shed my blood;</l>
<l>and though you wait your turn and chance at me;</l>
<l>still I will undertake the quest and will</l>
<l>try all my skill to bring you back with me.</l>
<l>If my good fortune then will favor me,</l>
<l>I shall obtain your arrows; as I made</l>
<l>the Trojan seer my captive, as I learned</l>
<l>the heavenly oracles and fate of Troy,</l>
<l>and as I brought back through a host of foes</l>
<l>Minerva's image from the citadel.</l>

    
<l>“And is it possible, Ajax may now</l>
<l>compare himself with me? Truly the Fates</l>
<l>will hold Troy from our capture, if we leave</l>
<l>the statue. Where is valiant Ajax now,</l>
<l>where are the boasts of that tremendous man?</l>
<l>Why are you trembling, while Ulysses dares</l>
<l>to go beyond our guards and brave the night?</l>
<l>In spite of hostile swords, he goes within</l>
<l>not only the strong walls of Troy but even</l>
<l>the citadel, lifts up the goddess from</l>
<l>her shrine, and takes her through the enemy!</l>
<l>If I had not done this, Telamon's son</l>
<l>would bear his shield of seven bull hides in vain.</l>
<l>That night I gained the victory over Troy—</l>
<l>'Twas then I won our war with Pergama,</l>
<l>because I made it possible to win.</l>

    
<l>“Stop hinting by your look and muttered words</l>
<l>that Diomed was my partner in the deed.</l>
<l>The praise he won is his. You, certainly</l>
<l>fought not alone, when you held up your shield</l>
<l>to save the allied fleet: a multitude</l>
<l>was with you, but a single man gave me</l>
<l>his valued help.</l>

    
<l>“And if he did not know</l>
<l>a fighting man can not gain victory</l>
<l>so surely as the wise man, that the prize</l>
<l>is given to something rarer than a brave right hand,</l>
<l>he would himself be a contender now</l>
<l>for these illustrious arms. Ajax the less</l>
<l>would have come forward too, so would the fierce</l>
<l>Eurypylus, so would Andraemon's son.</l>
<l>Nor would Idomeneus withhold his claim,</l>
<l>nor would his countryman Meriones.</l>
<l>Yes, Menelaus too would seek the prize.</l>
<l>All these brave men, my equals in the field,</l>
<l>have yielded to my wisdom.</l>

    
<l>“Your right hand</l>
<l>is valuable in war, your temper stands</l>
<l>in need of my direction. You have strength</l>
<l>without intelligence; I look out for</l>
<l>the future. You are able in the fight;</l>
<l>I help our king to find the proper time.</l>
<l>Your body may give service, and my mind</l>
<l>must point the way: and just as much as he</l>
<l>who guides the ship must be superior</l>
<l>to him who rows it; and we all agree</l>
<l>the general is greater than the soldier; so,</l>
<l>do I excel you. In the body lives</l>
<l>an intellect much rarer than a hand,</l>
<l>by that we measure human excellence.</l>

    
<l>“O chieftains, recompense my vigilance!</l>
<l>For all these years of anxious care, award</l>
<l>this honor to my many services.</l>
<l>Our victory is in sight; I have removed</l>
<l>the opposing fates and, opening wide the way</l>
<l>to capture Pergama, have captured it.</l>
<l>Now by our common hopes, by Troy's high walls</l>
<l>already tottering and about to fall,</l>
<l>and by the gods that I won from the foe,</l>
<l>by what remains for wisdom to devise</l>
<l>or what may call for bold and fearless deeds—</l>
<l>if you think any hope is left for Troy,</l>
<l>remember me! Or, if you do not give</l>
<l>these arms to me, then give them all to her!”</l>
<l>And he pointed to Minerva's fateful head.</l>

    
<l>The assembled body of the chiefs was moved;</l>
<l>and then, appeared the power of eloquence:</l>
<l>the fluent man received, amid applause,</l>
<l>the arms of the brave man. His rival, who</l>
<l>so often when alone, stood firm against</l>
<l>great Hector and the sword, and flames and Jove,</l>
<l>stood not against a single passion, wrath.</l>
<l>The unconquerable was conquered by his grief.</l>

    
<l>He drew his sword, and said:—“This is at least</l>
<l>my own; or will Ulysses also claim</l>
<l>this, for himself. I must use this against</l>
<l>myself—the blade which often has been wet,</l>
<l>dripping with blood of Phrygians I have slain,.</l>
<l>Will drip with his own master's:blood,</l>
<l>lest any man but Ajax vanquish Ajax.”</l>
<l>Saying this, he turned toward the vital spot</l>
<l>in his own breast, which never had felt a wound,</l>
<l>the fated sword and plunged it deeply in. </l>
<l>though many sought to aid, no hand had strength</l>
<l>to draw that steel—deep driven. The blood itself</l>
<l>unaided drove it out. The ensanguined earth</l>
<l>sprouted from her green turf that purple flower</l>
<l>which grew of old from Hyacinthine blood.</l>
<l>Its petals now are charged with double freight—</l>
<l>the warrior's name, Apollo's cry of woe.</l>


Hecuba.
HECUBA TRANSFORMED

<l>The conqueror, Ulysses, now set sail,</l>
<l>for Lemnos, country of Hypsipyle,</l>
<l>and for the land of Thoas, famed afar,</l>
<l>those regions infamous in olden days,</l>
<l>where women slew their husbands. So he went</l>
<l>that he might capture and bring back with him</l>
<l>the arrows of brave Hercules. When these</l>
<l>were given back to the Greeks, their lord with them,</l>
<l>a final hand at last prevailed to end</l>
<l>that long fought war. Both Troy and Priam fell,</l>
<l>and Priam's wretched wife lost all she had,</l>
<l>until at last she lost her human form.</l>
<l>Her savage barkings frightened foreign lands,</l>
<l>where the long Hellespont is narrowed down.</l>

    
<l>Great Troy was burning: while the fire still raged,</l>
<l>Jove's altar drank old Priam's scanty blood.</l>
<l>The priestess of Apollo then, alas!</l>
<l>Was dragged by her long hair, while up towards heaven</l>
<l>she lifted supplicating hands in vain.</l>
<l>The Trojan matrons, clinging while they could</l>
<l>to burning temples and ancestral gods,</l>
<l>victorious Greeks drag off as welcome spoil.</l>
<l>Astyanax was hurled down from the very tower</l>
<l>from which he often had looked forth and seen</l>
<l>his father, by his mother pointed out,</l>
<l>when Hector fought for honor and his country's weal.</l>

    
<l>Now Boreas counsels to depart. The sails,</l>
<l>moved by a prosperous breeze, resound and wave—</l>
<l>the Trojan women cry,—“Farewell to Troy!</l>
<l>Ah, we are hurried off! ” and, falling down,</l>
<l>they kiss the soil, and leave the smoking roofs</l>
<l>of their loved native land. The last to go</l>
<l>on board the fleet was Hecuba, a sight</l>
<l>most pitiful. She was found among the tombs</l>
<l>of her lost sons. While she embraced each urn</l>
<l>and fondly kissed their bones, Ulysses came</l>
<l>with ruthless hands and bore her off, his prize</l>
<l>she in her bosom took away the urn</l>
<l>of Hector only, and upon his grave</l>
<l>she left some white hair taken from her head,</l>
<l>a meager gift, her white hair and her tears.</l>

    
<l>Across the strait from Troy, there is a land</l>
<l>claimed by Bistonian men, and in that land</l>
<l>was a rich palace, built there by a king</l>
<l>named Polymnestor. To him the Phrygian king</l>
<l>in secret gave his youngest son to rear,</l>
<l>his Polydorus, safe from Troy and war,</l>
<l>a prudent course, if he had not sent gold</l>
<l>arousing greed, incitement to a crime.</l>
<l>Soon, when the fortunes of the Trojans fell,</l>
<l>that wicked king of Thrace took his own sword,</l>
<l>and pierced the throat of his poor foster son</l>
<l>and then, as if the deed could be concealed,</l>
<l>if he removed the body, hurled the boy</l>
<l>from a wild cliff into the waves below.</l>

    
<l>Until the sea might be more calm, and gales</l>
<l>of wind might be subdued, Atrides moored</l>
<l>his fleet of ships upon the Thracian shore;</l>
<l>there, from wide gaping earth, Achilles rose,</l>
<l>as large as when he lived, with look as fierce,</l>
<l>as when his sword once threatened Agamemnon.</l>
<l>“Forgetting me do you depart, O Greeks?”</l>
<l>He said, “And is your grateful! memory</l>
<l>of all my worth interred with my bones?</l>
<l>Do not do so. And that my sepulchre</l>
<l>may have due worship, let Polyxena</l>
<l>be immolated to appease the ghost:</l>
<l>of dead Achilles.” Fiercely so he spoke.</l>

    
<l>The old friends of Achilles all obeyed</l>
<l>his unforgiving shade; and instantly</l>
<l>the noble and unhappy virgin—brave,</l>
<l>more like a man than woman—was torn from</l>
<l>her mother's bosom, cherished more by her,</l>
<l>since widowed and alone. And then they led</l>
<l>the virgin as a sacrifice from there</l>
<l>up to the cruel altar. When the maid</l>
<l>observed the savage rites prepared for her,</l>
<l>and when she noticed Neoptolemus</l>
<l>stand by her with his cruel sword in hand,</l>
<l>his fixed eyes on her countenance; she said:—</l>

    
<l>“Do not delay my generous gift of blood,</l>
<l>with no resistance thrust the ready steel</l>
<l>into my throat or breast!” And then she laid</l>
<l>both throat and bosom bare. “Polyxena</l>
<l>would never wish to live in slavery.</l>
<l>And such rites win no favor from a god.</l>
<l>Only I fondly wish my mother might</l>
<l>not know that I have died. My love of her</l>
<l>takes from my joy in death and gives me fear.</l>
<l>Not my death truly, but her own sad life</l>
<l>should be the most lamented in her tears.</l>
<l>Now let your men stand back, that I may go</l>
<l>with dignity down to the Stygian shades,</l>
<l>and, if my plea is just, let no man's hand</l>
<l>touch my pure virgin body. A nobler gift</l>
<l>to him, whoever he may be, whom you</l>
<l>desire to placate with my death today,</l>
<l>shall be a free maid's blood. But, if my words—</l>
<l>my parting wish, has power to touch your hearts,</l>
<l>(King Priam's daughter, not a captive, pleads)</l>
<l>freely return my body to my mother,</l>
<l>let her not pay with gold for the sad right</l>
<l>to bury me—but only with her tears!</l>
<l>Yes, when she could, she also paid with gold.”</l>

    
<l>After she said these words, the people could</l>
<l>no more restrain their tears; but no one saw</l>
<l>her shed one tear. Even the priest himself,</l>
<l>reluctantly and weeping, drove the steel</l>
<l>into her proffered breast. On failing knees</l>
<l>she sank down to the earth; but still maintained</l>
<l>a countenance undaunted to the last:</l>
<l>and, even unto death, it was her care</l>
<l>to cover all that ought to be concealed,</l>
<l>and save the value of chaste modesty.</l>

    
<l>The Trojan matrons took her and recalled,</l>
<l>lamenting, all the sons of Priam dead,</l>
<l>the wealth of blood one house had shed for all.</l>
<l>And they bewailed the chaste Polyxena</l>
<l>and you, her mother, only lately called</l>
<l>a royal mother and a royal wife,—</l>
<l>the soul of Asia's fair prosperity,;</l>
<l>now lowest fallen in all the wreck of Troy.</l>

    
<l>The conquering Ulysses only claimed</l>
<l>her his because she had brought Hector forth:</l>
<l>and Hector hardly found a master for</l>
<l>his mother. She continued to embrace</l>
<l>the body of a soul so brave, and shed</l>
<l>her tears, as she had shed them often before</l>
<l>for country lost, for sons, for royal mate.</l>
<l>She bathed her daughter's wounds with tears and kissed</l>
<l>them with her lips and once more beat her breast.</l>
<l>Her white hair streamed down in the clotting blood,</l>
<l>she tore her breast, and this and more she said:</l>


    
<l>“My daughter, what further sorrow can be mine?</l>
<l>My daughter you lie dead, I see your wounds—</l>
<l>they are indeed my own. Lest I should lose</l>
<l>one child of mine without a cruel sword,</l>
<l>you have your wound. I thought, because</l>
<l>you were a woman, you were safe from swords.</l>
<l>But you, a woman, felt the deadly steel.</l>
<l>That same Achilles, who has given to death</l>
<l>so many of your brothers, caused your death,</l>
<l>the bane of Troy and the serpent by my nest!</l>
<l>When Paris and when Phoebus with their shafts</l>
<l>had laid him low, ‘Ah, now at least,’ I said,</l>
<l>‘Achilles will no longer cause me dread.’</l>
<l>Yet even then he still was to be feared.</l>
<l>For him I have been fertile! Mighty Troy</l>
<l>now lies in ruin, and the public woe</l>
<l>is ended in one vast calamity.</l>
<l>For me alone the woe of Troy still lives.</l>

    
<l>“But lately on the pinnacle of fame,</l>
<l>surrounded by my powerful sons-in-law,</l>
<l>daughters, and daughters-in-law, and strong</l>
<l>in my great husband, I am exiled now,</l>
<l>and destitute, and forced from the sad tombs</l>
<l>of those I love, to wretched slavery,</l>
<l>serving Penelope: who showing me</l>
<l>to curious dames of Ithaca, will point</l>
<l>and say, while I am bending to my task,</l>
<l>‘Look at that woman who was widely known,</l>
<l>the mother of great Hector, once the wife</l>
<l>of Priam!’ After so many have been lost,</l>
<l>now you, last comfort of a mother's grief,</l>
<l>must make atonement on the foeman's tomb.</l>
<l>I bore a victim for my enemy.</l>

    
<l>“Why do I live—an iron witted wretch?</l>
<l>Why do I linger? Why does cruel age</l>
<l>detain me? Why, pernicious deities,</l>
<l>thus hold me to this earth, unless you will</l>
<l>that I may weep at future funerals?</l>
<l>After the fall of Troy, who would suppose</l>
<l>King Priam could be happy? Blest in death,</l>
<l>he has not seen my daughter's dreadful fate.</l>
<l>He lost at once his kingdom and his life.</l>

    
<l>“Can I imagine you, a royal maid,</l>
<l>will soon be honored with due funeral rites,</l>
<l>and will be buried in our family tomb?</l>
<l>Such fortune comes no more to your sad house.</l>
<l>A drift of foreign sand will be your grave,</l>
<l>the parting gift will be your mother's tears.</l>
<l>We have lost everything! But no, there is</l>
<l>one reason why I should endure a while.</l>
<l>His mother's dearest, now her only child,</l>
<l>once youngest of that company of sons,</l>
<l>my Polydorus lives here on these shores</l>
<l>protected by the friendly Thracian king.</l>
<l>Then why delay to bathe these cruel wounds,</l>
<l>her dear face spattered with the dreadful blood?”</l>

    
<l>So Hecuba went wailing towards the shore</l>
<l>with aged step and tearing her gray hair.</l>
<l>At last the unhappy mother said, “Give me</l>
<l>an urn; O, Trojan women!” for, she wished</l>
<l>to dip up salt sea water. But just then,</l>
<l>she saw the corpse of her last son, thrown out</l>
<l>upon the shore; her Polydorus, killed,</l>
<l>disfigured with deep wounds of Thracian swords.</l>

    
<l>The Trojan women cried aloud, and she</l>
<l>was struck dumb with her agony, which quite</l>
<l>consumed both voice and tears within her heart—</l>
<l>rigid and still she seemed as a hard rock.</l>
<l>And now she gazes at the earth in front</l>
<l>now lifts her haggard face up toward the skies,</l>
<l>now scans that body lying stark and dead,</l>
<l>now scans his wounds and most of all the wounds.</l>
<l>She arms herself and draws up all her wrath.</l>
<l>It burned as if she still held regal power</l>
<l>she gave up all life to the single thought</l>
<l>of quick revenge. Just as a lioness</l>
<l>rages when plundered of her suckling cub</l>
<l>and follows on his trail the unseen foe,</l>
<l>so, Hecuba with rage mixed in her grief</l>
<l>forgetful of her years, not her intent,</l>
<l>went hastily to Polymnestor, who</l>
<l>contrived this dreadful murder, and desired</l>
<l>an interview, pretending it was her wish</l>
<l>to show him hidden gold, for her lost son.</l>

    
<l>The Odrysian king believed it all:</l>
<l>accustomed to the love of gain, he went</l>
<l>with her, in secret, to the spot she chose.</l>
<l>Then craftily he said in his bland way:</l>
<l>“Oh, Hecuba, you need not wait, give now,</l>
<l>munificently to your son—and all</l>
<l>you give, and all that you have given,</l>
<l>by the good gods, I swear, shall be his own.”</l>

    
<l>She eyed him sternly as he spoke</l>
<l>and swore so falsely.—Then her rage boiled over,</l>
<l>and, seconded by all her captive train,</l>
<l>she flew at him and drove her fingers deep</l>
<l>in his perfidious eyes; and tore them from</l>
<l>his face—and plunged her hands into the raw</l>
<l>and bleeding sockets (passion made her strong),</l>
<l>defiled with his bad blood. How could she tear</l>
<l>his eyes, gone from their seats? She wildly gouged</l>
<l>the sightless sockets of his bleeding face!</l>

    
<l>The Thracians, angered by such violence done</l>
<l>upon their king, immediately attacked</l>
<l>the Trojan matron with their stones and darts</l>
<l>but she with hoarse growling and snapping jaws</l>
<l>sprang at the stones, and, when she tried to speak,</l>
<l>she barked like a fierce dog. The place still bears</l>
<l>a name suggested by her hideous change.</l>
<l>And she, long mindful! of her old time woe,</l>
<l>ran howling dismally in Thracian fields.</l>

    
<l>Her sad fate moved the Trojans and the Greeks,</l>
<l>her friends and foes, and all the heavenly gods.</l>
<l>Yes all, for even the sister-wife of Jove</l>
<l>denied that Hecuba deserved such fate.</l>


Memnon.
THE BIRDS OF MEMNON

<l>Although Aurora had given aid to Troy,</l>
<l>she had no heart nor leisure to be moved</l>
<l>by fall of Troy or fate of Hecuba.</l>
<l>At home she bore a greater grief and care;</l>
<l>her loss of Memnon is afflicting her.</l>
<l>Aurora, his rose-tinted mother, saw</l>
<l>him perish by Achilles' deadly spear,</l>
<l>upon the Phrygian plain. She saw his death,</l>
<l>and the loved rose that lights the dawning hour</l>
<l>turned death-pale, and the sky was veiled in clouds.</l>

    
<l>The parent could not bear to see his limbs</l>
<l>laid on the final flames. Just as she was,</l>
<l>with loose hair streaming round her, she did not</l>
<l>disdain to crouch down at the knees of Jove,</l>
<l>and said these sad words added to her tears:</l>

    
<l>“Beneath all those whom golden heaven sustains;</l>
<l>(inferior, for see, through all the world</l>
<l>my temples are so few) I have come now</l>
<l>a goddess, to you; not with any hope</l>
<l>that you may grant me temples, festivals,</l>
<l>and altars, heated with devoted fires:</l>
<l>but if you will consider the good deeds,</l>
<l>which I, a woman, may yet do for you,</l>
<l>when at the dawn I mark the edge of night;</l>
<l>then you may think of some reward for me.</l>
<l>But that is not my care; nor is it now</l>
<l>Aurora's purpose here, that she should plead</l>
<l>for honors, though deserved. I come bereaved,</l>
<l>of my son Memnon, who in vain bore arms</l>
<l>to aid his uncle and in prime of life</l>
<l>(0, thus you willed it!) fell stricken by the sword</l>
<l>of great Achilles. Give my son, I pray,</l>
<l>O highest ruler of the gods, some honor,</l>
<l>some comfort for his death, a little ease</l>
<l>his mother's grief.” Jove nodded his assent.</l>

    
<l>Immediately the high-wrought funeral-pile</l>
<l>of Memnon fell down with its lofty fire,</l>
<l>and volumes of black smoke obscured the day,</l>
<l>as streams exhaling their dense rising fogs,</l>
<l>exclude the bright sun from the land below.</l>
<l>Black ashes fly and, rolling up a shape,</l>
<l>retain a form and gather heat and life</l>
<l>out of the fire. Their lightness gave them wings,</l>
<l>first like a bird and then in fact a bird.</l>

    
<l>The wings move whirring. In the neighboring air</l>
<l>uncounted sisters, of one birth and growth</l>
<l>together make one noise. Three times they flew</l>
<l>around the funeral pile; and thrice the sound</l>
<l>accordant of their fluttering wings went swift</l>
<l>upon the soft breeze. When they turned about,</l>
<l>their fourth flight in the skies divided them.</l>
<l>As two fierce races from two hostile camps,</l>
<l>clash in their warfare, these bird-sisters with</l>
<l>their beaks and crooked claws clashed, passionate,</l>
<l>until their tired wings and opposing breasts</l>
<l>could not sustain them. And those kindred-foes</l>
<l>fell down a sacrifice, memorial,</l>
<l>to Memnon's ashes buried in that place.</l>

    
<l>Brave Memnon, author of their birth, has given</l>
<l>his name to those birds, marvellously formed,—</l>
<l>and from him they are called Memnonides.—</l>
<l>now, always when the Sun has passed the twelve</l>
<l>signs of the Zodiac, they war again,</l>
<l>to perish as a sacrifice for him.</l>

    
<l>So others grieved, while Dymas' royal daughter</l>
<l>was barking: but Aurora overcome</l>
<l>with lasting sorrows, could not think of her:</l>
<l>and even now, she sheds affectionate tears:</l>
<l>and sprinkles them as dew on all the world.</l>


Aeneas apud Anium. Scylla.
DAUGHTERS OF ANIUS TRANSFORMED

<l>The Fates did not allow the hope of Troy</l>
<l>to be destroyed entirely with her walls.</l>
<l>Aeneas, the heroic son of Venus,</l>
<l>bore on his shoulders holy images</l>
<l>and still another holy weight, his sire,</l>
<l>a venerable burden. From all his wealth</l>
<l>the pious hero chose this for his care</l>
<l>together with his child, Ascanius.</l>
<l>Then with a fleet of exiles he sails forth,</l>
<l>he leaves Antandrus, leaves the wicked realm</l>
<l>and shore of Thrace now dripping with the blood</l>
<l>of Polydorus. With fair winds and tide</l>
<l>he and his comrades reach Apollo's isle.</l>

    
<l>Good Anius, king of Delos, vigilant</l>
<l>for all his subjects' welfare, and as priest</l>
<l>devoted to Apollo, took him there</l>
<l>into his temple and his home, and showed</l>
<l>the city, the famed shrines, and the two trees</l>
<l>which once Latona, while in labor, held.</l>
<l>They burned sweet incense, adding to it wine,</l>
<l>and laid the flesh of cattle in the flames,</l>
<l>an offering marked by custom for the god.</l>
<l>Then in the palace and its kingly hall,</l>
<l>reclining on luxurious couches, they</l>
<l>drank flowing wine with Ceres' gifts of food.</l>

    
<l>But old Anchises asked: “O chosen priest</l>
<l>of Phoebus, can I be deceived? When first</l>
<l>I saw these walls, did you not have a son,</l>
<l>and twice two daughters? Is it possible</l>
<l>I am mistaken?” Anius replied,—</l>
<l>shaking his temples wreathed with fillets white,—</l>
<l>“It can be no mistake, great hero, you</l>
<l>did see the father of five children then,</l>
<l>(so much the risk of fortune may affect</l>
<l>the best of men). You see me now, almost</l>
<l>bereft of all. For what assistance can</l>
<l>my absent son afford, while he is king,</l>
<l>the ruler over Andros—that land named</l>
<l>for his name—over which he rules for me?</l>

    
<l>“The Delian god gave to my son the art</l>
<l>of augury; and likewise, Liber gave</l>
<l>my daughters precious gifts exceeding all</l>
<l>my wishes and belief: since, every thing</l>
<l>my daughters touched assumed the forms of corn,</l>
<l>of sparkling wine, or gray-green olive oil.</l>
<l>Most surely, wonderful advantages.</l>

    
<l>“Soon as Atrides, he who conquered Troy</l>
<l>had heard of this (for you should not suppose</l>
<l>that we, too, did not suffer from your storms)</l>
<l>he dragged my daughters there with savage force,</l>
<l>from my loved bosom to his hostile camp,</l>
<l>and ordered them to feed the Argive fleet,</l>
<l>by their divinely given power of touch.</l>

    
<l>“Whichever way they could, they made escape</l>
<l>two hastened to Euboea, and two sought</l>
<l>their brother's island, Andros. Quickly then</l>
<l>an Argive squadron, following, threatened war,</l>
<l>unless they were surrendered. The brother's love</l>
<l>gave way to fear. And there is reason why</l>
<l>you should forgive a timid brother's fear:</l>
<l>he had no warrior like Aeneas, none</l>
<l>like Hector, by whose prowess you held Troy</l>
<l>from its destruction through ten years of war.</l>

    
<l>“Strong chains were brought to hold my daughters' arms.</l>
<l>Both lifted suppliant hands, which still were free,</l>
<l>to heaven and cried, ‘0, Father Bacchus! give</l>
<l>us needed aid!’ And he who had before</l>
<l>given them the power of touch, did give them aid—</l>
<l>if giving freedom without human shape</l>
<l>can be called giving aid.—I never knew</l>
<l>by what means they lost shape, and cannot tell;</l>
<l>but their calamity is surely known:</l>
<l>my daughters were transformed to snow-white doves,</l>
<l>white birds of Venus, guardian of your days.”</l>

    
<l>With this and other talk they shared the feast,</l>
<l>then left the table and retired to sleep.</l>
<l>They rose up with the day, and went at once</l>
<l>to hear the oracle of Phoebus speak.</l>
<l>He counselled them to leave that land and find</l>
<l>their ancient mother and their kindred shores.</l>

    
<l>The king attended them, and gave them gifts</l>
<l>when ready to depart; a sceptre to</l>
<l>Anchises, and a robe and quiver to</l>
<l>his grandson, and he gave a goblet to</l>
<l>Aeneas, that which formerly was sent</l>
<l>to him by Therses, once his Theban guest.</l>
<l>Therses had sent it from Aonian shores;</l>
<l>but Alcon the Hylean should be named,</l>
<l>for he had made the goblet and inscribed</l>
<l>a pictured story on the polished side.</l>

    
<l>There was a city shown with seven gates,</l>
<l>from which the name could be derived by all.</l>
<l>Outside the walls was a sad funeral, </l>
<l>and tombs and fires and funeral pyres were shown,</l>
<l>and many matrons with dishevelled hair</l>
<l>and naked breasts, expressive of their grief,</l>
<l>and many nymphs too, weeping mournfully</l>
<l>because their streams were dry. Without a leaf</l>
<l>the bare trees stood straight up and the she goats</l>
<l>were nibbling in dry, stony fields. And there he carved</l>
<l>Orion's daughters in the Theban square,</l>
<l>one giving her bare throat a cruel cut,</l>
<l>one with her shuttle making clumsy wounds;</l>
<l>both dying for their people. Next they were borne</l>
<l>out through the city with doe funeral pomp,</l>
<l>and mourning crowds were gathered round their pyre.</l>
<l>Then from the virgin ashes, lest the race</l>
<l>should die. twin youths arose, whom fame</l>
<l>has named Coroni and they shared</l>
<l>in all the rites becoming for their mothers' dust.</l>
<l>Even so in shining figures all was shown</l>
<l>inscribed on ancient bronze. The top rim, made</l>
<l>quite rough, was gilded with acanthus leaves.</l>

    
<l>Presents of equal worth the Trojans gave:</l>
<l>a maple incense casket for the priest,</l>
<l>a bowl, a crown adorned with gold and gems.</l>


GALATEA AND POLYPHEMUS

<l>Then, recollecting how the Trojans had</l>
<l>derived their origin from Teucer's race,</l>
<l>they sailed to Crete but there could not endure</l>
<l>ills sent by Jove, and, having left behind</l>
<l>the hundred cities, they desired to reach</l>
<l>the western harbors of the Ausonian land.</l>
<l>Wintry seas then tossed the heroic band,</l>
<l>and in a treacherous harbor of those isles,</l>
<l>called Strophades, Aello frightened them.</l>
<l>They passed Dulichium's port, and Ithaca,</l>
<l>Samos, and all the homes of Neritos,—</l>
<l>the kingdom of the shrewd deceitful man,</l>
<l>Ulysses; and they reached Ambracia,</l>
<l>contended for by those disputing gods;</l>
<l>which is today renowned abroad, because</l>
<l>of Actian Apollo, and the stone</l>
<l>seen there conspicuous as a transformed judge;</l>
<l>they saw Dodona, vocal with its oaks;</l>
<l>and also, the well known Chaonian bays,</l>
<l>where sons of the Molossian king escaped</l>
<l>with wings attached, from unavailing flames.</l>

    
<l>They set their sails then for the neighboring land</l>
<l>of the Phaeacians, rich with luscious fruit:</l>
<l>then for Epirus and to Buthrotos,</l>
<l>and came then to a mimic town of Troy,</l>
<l>ruled by the Phrygian seer. With prophecies</l>
<l>which Helenus, the son of Priam, gave,</l>
<l>they came to Sicily, whose three high capes</l>
<l>jut outward in the sea. Of these three points</l>
<l>Pachynos faces towards the showery south;</l>
<l>and Lilybaeum is exposed to soft</l>
<l>delicious zephyrs; but Peloros looks</l>
<l>out towards the Bears which never touch the sea.</l>
<l>The Trojans came there. Favored by the tide,</l>
<l>and active oars, by nightfall all the fleet</l>
<l>arrived together on Zanclaean sands.</l>
<l>Scylla upon the right infests the shore,</l>
<l>Charybdis, restless on the left, destroys.</l>

    
<l>Charybdis swallows and then vomits forth</l>
<l>misfortuned ships that she has taken down;</l>
<l>Scylla's dark waist is girt with savage dogs.</l>
<l>She has a maiden's face, and, if we may believe</l>
<l>what poets tell, she was in olden time</l>
<l>a maiden. Many suitors courted her,</l>
<l>but she repulsed them; and, because she was</l>
<l>so much beloved by all the Nereids,</l>
<l>she sought these nymphs and used to tell</l>
<l>how she escaped from the love-stricken youths.</l>

    
<l>But Galatea, while her loosened locks</l>
<l>were being combed, said to her visitor,—</l>
<l>“Truly, O maiden, a gentle race of men</l>
<l>courts you, and so you can, and do, refuse</l>
<l>all with impunity. But I, whose sire</l>
<l>is Nereus, whom the azure Doris bore,</l>
<l>though guarded by so many sister nymphs,</l>
<l>escaped the Cyclops' love with tragic loss.”</l>
<l>And, sobbing, she was choked with tears.</l>

    
<l>When with her fingers, marble white and smooth,</l>
<l>Scylla had wiped away the rising tears</l>
<l>of sorrow and had comforted the nymph,</l>
<l>she said, “Tell me, dear goddess, and do not</l>
<l>conceal from me (for I am true to you)</l>
<l>the cause of your great sorrows.” And the nymph,</l>
<l>daughter of Nereus, thus replied to her:—</l>


Acis et Galatea. Polyphemus.

<l>“Acis, the son of Faunus and the nymph</l>
<l>Symaethis, was a great delight to his</l>
<l>dear father and his mother, but even more</l>
<l>to me, for he alone had won my love.</l>
<l>Eight birthdays having passed a second time,</l>
<l>his tender cheeks were marked with softest down.</l>

    
<l>“While I pursued him with a constant love,</l>
<l>the Cyclops followed me as constantly.</l>
<l>And, should you ask me, I could not declare</l>
<l>whether my hatred of him, or my love</l>
<l>of Acis was the stronger.—They were equal.</l>

    
<l>“O gentle Venus! what power equals yours!</l>
<l>That savage, dreaded by the forest trees,</l>
<l>feared by the stranger who beholds his face</l>
<l>contemner of Olympus and the gods,</l>
<l>now he can feel what love is. He is filled</l>
<l>with passion for me. He burns hot for me,</l>
<l>forgetful of his cattle and his caves.</l>

    
<l>“Now, Polyphemus, wretched Cyclops, you</l>
<l>are careful of appearance, and you try</l>
<l>the art of pleasing. You have even combed</l>
<l>your stiffened hair with rakes: it pleases you</l>
<l>to trim your shaggy beard with sickles, while</l>
<l>you gaze at your fierce features in a pool</l>
<l>so earnest to compose them. Love of flesh,</l>
<l>ferocity and your keen thirst for blood</l>
<l>have ceased. The ships may safely come and go!</l>

    
<l>“While all this happened, Telemus arrived</l>
<l>at the Sicilian Aetna—Telemus,</l>
<l>the son of Eurymus, who never could</l>
<l>mistake an omen, met the dreadful fierce,</l>
<l>huge Cyclops, Polyphemus, and he said,</l>
<l>‘That single eye now midmost in your brow</l>
<l>Ulysses will take from you.’ In reply,</l>
<l>the Cyclops only laughed at him and said,</l>
<l>‘Most silly of the prophets! you are wrong,</l>
<l>a maiden has already taken it!’</l>
<l>So he made fun of Telemus, who warned</l>
<l>him vainly of the truth—and after that,</l>
<l>he either burdened with his bulk the shore,</l>
<l>by stalking back and forth with lengthy strides,</l>
<l>or came back weary to his shaded cave.</l>

    
<l>“A wedge-formed hill projects far in the sea</l>
<l>and either side there flow the salty waves.</l>
<l>To this the giant savage climbed and sat</l>
<l>upon the highest point. The wooly flock,</l>
<l>no longer guided by him, followed after.</l>
<l>There, after he had laid his pine tree down,</l>
<l>which served him for a staff, although so tall</l>
<l>it seemed best fitted for a ship's high mast,</l>
<l>he played his shepherd pipes—in them I saw</l>
<l>a hundred reeds. The very mountains felt</l>
<l>the pipings of that shepherd, and the waves</l>
<l>beneath him shook respondent to each note.</l>
<l>All this time I was hidden by a rock,</l>
<l>reclining on the bosom of my own</l>
<l>dear Acis; and, although afar, I heard</l>
<l>such words as these, which I can not forget:—</l>

    
<l>‘O Galatea, fairer than the flower</l>
<l>of snow-white privet, and more blooming than</l>
<l>the meadows, and more slender than the tall</l>
<l>delightful alder, brighter than smooth glass,</l>
<l>more wanton than the tender skipping kid,</l>
<l>smoother than shells worn by continual floods,</l>
<l>more pleasing than the winter sun, or than</l>
<l>the summer shade, more beautiful than fruit</l>
<l>of apple trees, more pleasing to the sight</l>
<l>than lofty plane tree, clearer than pure ice,</l>
<l>and sweeter than the ripe grape, softer than</l>
<l>soft swan-down and the softest curdled milk;</l>
<l>alas, and if you did not fly from me,</l>
<l>I would declare you are more beautiful</l>
<l>than any watered garden of this world.</l>

    
<l>‘And yet, O Galatea; I must say,</l>
<l>that you are wilder than all untrained bullocks,</l>
<l>harder than seasoned oak, more treacherous</l>
<l>than tumbled waters, tougher than the twigs</l>
<l>of osier and the white vine, harder to move</l>
<l>than cliffs which front these waves, more violent</l>
<l>than any torrent, you are prouder than</l>
<l>the flattered peacock, fiercer than hot fire,</l>
<l>rougher than thistles, and more cruel than</l>
<l>the pregnant she-bear, deafer than the waves</l>
<l>of stormy seas, more deadly savage than</l>
<l>the trodden water-snake: and, (what I would</l>
<l>endeavor surely to deprive you of)</l>
<l>your speed is fleeter than the deer</l>
<l>pursued by frightful barkings, and more swift</l>
<l>than rapid storm-winds and the flitting air.</l>

    
<l>‘But Galatea, if you knew me well</l>
<l>you would regret your hasty flight from me,</l>
<l>and you would even blame your own delay,</l>
<l>and strive for my affection. I now hold</l>
<l>the choice part of this mountain for my cave,</l>
<l>roofed over with the native rock. The sun</l>
<l>is not felt in the heat of middle day,</l>
<l>nor is the winter felt there: apples load</l>
<l>the bending boughs and luscious grapes</l>
<l>hang on the lengthened vines, resembling gold,</l>
<l>and purple grapes as rich—I keep for you</l>
<l>those two delicious fruits. With your own hands,</l>
<l>you shall yourself uncover strawberries,</l>
<l>growing so soft beneath the woodland shade;</l>
<l>you shall pluck corners in the autumn ripe,</l>
<l>and plums, not only darkened with black juice</l>
<l>but larger kinds as yellow as new wax.</l>
<l>If I may be your mate, you shall have chestnuts,</l>
<l>fruits of the arbute shall be always near,</l>
<l>and every tree shall yield at your desire.</l>

    
<l>‘The ewes here all are mine, and many more</l>
<l>are wandering in the valleys; and the woods</l>
<l>conceal a multitude—and many more</l>
<l>are penned within my caves. If you perchance</l>
<l>should ask me, I could never even guess</l>
<l>or count the number; it is for the poor</l>
<l>to count their cattle. Do not trust my word,</l>
<l>but go yourself and see with your own eyes,</l>
<l>how they can hardly stand up on their legs</l>
<l>because of their distended udders' weight.</l>

    
<l>‘I have lambs also, as a future flock,</l>
<l>kept in warm folds, and kids of their same age</l>
<l>in other folds. I always have supplies</l>
<l>of snow-white milk for drinking, and much more</l>
<l>is hardened with good rennet liquefied.</l>

    
<l>‘The common joys of ordinary things</l>
<l>will not be all you should expect of me—</l>
<l>tame does and hares and she-goats or a pair</l>
<l>of doves, or even a nest from a tall tree—</l>
<l>for I have found upon a mountain top,</l>
<l>the twin cubs of a shaggy wild she-bear,</l>
<l>of such appearance you can hardly know</l>
<l>the one from other. They will play with you.</l>
<l>The very day I found them I declared,</l>
<l>these I will keep for my dear loved one's joy.</l>

    
<l>‘Do now but raise your shining head above</l>
<l>the azure sea: come Galatea come,</l>
<l>and do not scorn my presents. Certainly,</l>
<l>I know myself, for only recently</l>
<l>I saw my own reflection pictured clear</l>
<l>in limpid water, and my features pleased</l>
<l>and charmed me when I saw it. See how huge</l>
<l>I am. Not even Jove in his high heaven</l>
<l>is larger than my body: this I say</l>
<l>because you tell me how imperial Jove</l>
<l>surpasses.—Who is he? I never knew.</l>

    
<l>‘My long hair plentifully hangs to hide</l>
<l>unpleasant features; as a grove of trees</l>
<l>overshadowing my shoulders. Never think</l>
<l>my body is uncomely, although rough,</l>
<l>thick set with wiry bristles. Every tree</l>
<l>without leaves is unseemly; every horse,</l>
<l>unless a mane hangs on his tawny neck;</l>
<l>feathers must cover birds; and their soft wool</l>
<l>is ornamental on the best formed sheep:</l>
<l>therefore a beard, and rough hair spread upon</l>
<l>the body is becoming to all men.</l>
<l>I have but one eye centered perfectly</l>
<l>within my forehead, so it seems most like</l>
<l>a mighty buckler. Ha! does not the Sun</l>
<l>see everything from heaven? Yet it has</l>
<l>but one eye.—</l>

    
<l>‘Galatea, you must know,</l>
<l>my father is chief ruler in your sea,</l>
<l>and therefor I now offer him to you</l>
<l>as your own father-in-law—But oh, do take</l>
<l>some pity on a suppliant,— and hear his prayer,</l>
<l>for only unto you my heart is given.</l>

    
<l>‘I, who despise the power of Jove, his heavens</l>
<l>and piercing lightnings, am afraid of you—</l>
<l>your wrath more fearful than the lightning's flash—</l>
<l>but I should be more patient under slights,</l>
<l>if you avoided all men: why reject</l>
<l>the Cyclops for the love that Acis gives?</l>
<l>And why prefer his smiles to my embraces,</l>
<l>but let him please himself, and let him please</l>
<l>you, Galatea, though against my will.</l>

    
<l>‘If I am given an opportunity</l>
<l>he will be shown that I have every strength</l>
<l>proportioned to a body vast as mine:</l>
<l>I will pull out his palpitating entrails,</l>
<l>and scatter his torn limbs about the fields</l>
<l>and over and throughout your salty waves;</l>
<l>and then let him unite himself to you.—</l>
<l>I burn so, and my slighted passion raves</l>
<l>with greater fury and I seem to hold</l>
<l>and carry Aetna in my breast—transferred</l>
<l>there with its flames—Oh Galatea! can</l>
<l>you listen to my passion thus unmoved!’</l>

    
<l>“I saw all this; and, after he in vain</l>
<l>had uttered such complaints, he stood up like</l>
<l>a raging bull whose heifer has been lost,</l>
<l>that cannot stand still, but must wander on</l>
<l>through brush and forests, that he knows so well:</l>
<l>when that fierce monster saw me and my Acis—</l>
<l>we neither knew nor guessed our fate—he roared:</l>
<l>‘I see you and you never will again</l>
<l>parade your love before me!’ In such a voice</l>
<l>as matched his giant size. All Aetna shook</l>
<l>and trembled at the noise; and I amazed</l>
<l>with horror, plunged into the adjoining sea.</l>

    
<l>“My loved one, Acis turned his back and fled</l>
<l>and cried out, ‘Help me Galatea, help!</l>
<l>0, let your parents help me, and admit</l>
<l>me safe within their realm; for I am now</l>
<l>near my destruction!’ But the Cyclops rushed</l>
<l>at him and hurled a fragment, he had torn</l>
<l>out from the mountain, and although the extreme</l>
<l>edge only of the rock could reach him there.</l>
<l>It buried him entirely.</l>

    
<l>“Then I did</l>
<l>the only thing the Fates permitted me:</l>
<l>I let my Acis take ancestral power</l>
<l>of river deities. The purple blood</l>
<l>flowed from beneath the rock, but soon</l>
<l>the sanguine richness faded and became</l>
<l>at first the color of a stream, disturbed</l>
<l>and muddied by a shower. And presently</l>
<l>it clarified.— The rock that had been thrown</l>
<l>then split in two, and through the cleft a reed,</l>
<l>stately and vigorous, arose to life.</l>
<l>And soon the hollow mouth in the great rock,</l>
<l>resounded with the waters gushing forth.</l>
<l>And wonderful to tell, a youth emerged,</l>
<l>the water flowing clear about his waist,</l>
<l>his new horns circled with entwining reeds,</l>
<l>and the youth certainly was Acis, though</l>
<l>he was of larger stature and his face</l>
<l>and features all were azure. Acis changed</l>
<l>into a stream which ever since that time</l>
<l>has flowed there and retained its former name.</l>


Glaucus.
GLAUCUS TRANSFORMED TO A SEA GOD

<l>So Galatea, after she had told</l>
<l>her sorrow, ceased; and, when the company</l>
<l>had gone from there, the Nereids swam again</l>
<l>in the calm and quiet waves. But Scylla soon</l>
<l>returned (because she did not trust herself</l>
<l>in deep salt waters) and she wandered there</l>
<l>naked of garments on the thirsty sand;</l>
<l>but, tired, by chance she found a lonely bay,</l>
<l>and cooled her limbs with its enclosing waves.</l>

    
<l>Then suddenly appeared a newly made</l>
<l>inhabitant of that deep sea, whose name</l>
<l>was Glaucus. Cleaving through the blue sea waves,</l>
<l>he swam towards her. His shape had been transformed</l>
<l>but lately for this watery life, while he</l>
<l>was living at Anthedon in Euboea.—</l>
<l>now he is lingering from desire for her</l>
<l>he saw there and speaks whatever words</l>
<l>he thought might stop her as she fled from him.</l>
<l>Yet still she fled from him, and swift through fear,</l>
<l>climbed to a mountain top above the sea.</l>
<l>Facing the waves, it rose in one huge peak,</l>
<l>parting the waters with a forest crown.</l>
<l>She stood on that high summit quite secure:</l>
<l>and, doubtful whether he might be a god</l>
<l>or monster, wondered at his flowing hair</l>
<l>which covered his broad shoulders and his back,—</l>
<l>and marvelled at the color of his skin</l>
<l>and at his waist merged into a twisted fish.</l>

    
<l>All this he noticed, and while leaning there</l>
<l>against a rock that stood near by, he said: —</l>

    
<l>“I am no monster, maiden, I am not</l>
<l>a savage beast; I am in truth a god</l>
<l>of waters, with such power upon the seas</l>
<l>as that of Proteus, Triton, or Palaemon—</l>
<l>reared on land the son of Athamas.</l>

    
<l>“Not long ago I was a mortal man,</l>
<l>yet even then my thought turned to the sea</l>
<l>and all my living came from waters deep,</l>
<l>for I would drag the nets that swept up fish,</l>
<l>or, seated on a rock, I flung the line</l>
<l>forth from the rod. The shore I loved was near</l>
<l>a verdant meadow. One side were the waves,</l>
<l>the other grass, which never had been touched</l>
<l>by horned, grazing cattle. Harmless sheep</l>
<l>and shaggy goats had never cropped it—no</l>
<l>industrious bee came there to harvest flowers;</l>
<l>no festive garlands had been gathered there,</l>
<l>adornments of the head; no mower's hands</l>
<l>had ever cut it. I was certainly</l>
<l>the first who ever sat upon that turf,—</l>
<l>while I was drying there the dripping nets.</l>
<l>And so that I might in due order count</l>
<l>the fish that I had caught, I laid out those</l>
<l>which by good chance were driven into my nets,</l>
<l>or credulous, were caught on my barbed hooks.</l>

    
<l>“It all seems like a fiction (but what good</l>
<l>can I derive from fictions?) just as soon</l>
<l>as any of my fish-prey touched the grass,</l>
<l>they instantly began to move and skip</l>
<l>as usual in sea water. While I paused</l>
<l>and wondered, all of them slid to the waves,</l>
<l>and left me, their late captor, and the shore.</l>

    
<l>“I was amazed and doubtful, a long time;</l>
<l>while I considered what could be the cause.</l>
<l>What god had done this? Or perhaps the juice</l>
<l>of some herb caused it? ‘But,’ I said, ‘what herb</l>
<l>can have such properties?’ and with my hand</l>
<l>I plucked the grass and chewed it with my teeth.</l>
<l>My throat had hardly time to swallow those</l>
<l>unheard of juices, when I suddenly</l>
<l>felt all my entrails throbbing inwardly,</l>
<l>and my entire mind also, felt possessed</l>
<l>by passions foreign to my life before.</l>

    
<l>“I could not stay in that place, and I said</l>
<l>with shouting, ‘Farewell! dry land! never more</l>
<l>shall I revisit you;’ and with those words</l>
<l>upon my lips, I plunged beneath the waves.</l>
<l>The gods of that deep water gave to me,</l>
<l>when they received me, kindred honors, while</l>
<l>they prayed Oceanus and Tethys both</l>
<l>to take from me such mortal essence as</l>
<l>might yet remain. So I was purified</l>
<l>by them and after a good charm had been</l>
<l>nine times repeated over me, which washed</l>
<l>away all guilt, I was commanded then</l>
<l>to put my breast beneath a hundred streams.</l>

    
<l>“So far I can relate to you all things</l>
<l>most worthy to be told; for all so far</l>
<l>I can remember; but from that time on</l>
<l>I was unconscious of the many things</l>
<l>that followed. When my mind returned to me,</l>
<l>I found myself entirely different</l>
<l>from what I was before; and my changed mind</l>
<l>was not the same as it had always been.</l>
<l>Then, for the first time I beheld this beard</l>
<l>so green in its deep color, and I saw</l>
<l>my flowing hair which now I sweep along</l>
<l>the spacious seas, and my huge shoulders with</l>
<l>their azure colored arms, and I observed</l>
<l>my leg extremities hung tapering</l>
<l>exactly perfect as a finny fish.</l>

    
<l>“But what avail is this new form to me.</l>
<l>Although it pleased the Ocean deities?</l>
<l>What benefit, although I am a god,</l>
<l>if you are not persuaded by these things?”</l>

    
<l>While he was telling wonders such as these—</l>
<l>quite ready to say more—Scylla arose</l>
<l>and left the god. Provoked at his repulse—</l>
<l>enraged, he hastened to the marvellous court</l>
<l>of Circe, well known daughter of the Sun.</l>

Myscelus. Croton.
MYSCELUS BUILDS THE CITY OF CROTONA

While this was happening, they began to seek<lb/>
for one who could endure the weight of such<lb/>
a task and could succeed a king so great;<lb/>
and Fame, the harbinger of truth, destined<lb/>
illustrious Numa for the sovereign power.<lb/>
It did not satisfy his heart to know<lb/>
only the Sabine ceremonials,<lb/>
and he conceived in his expansive mind<lb/>
much greater views, examining the depth <lb/>
and cause of things. His country and his cares<lb/>
forgotten, this desire led him to visit<lb/>
the city that once welcomed Hercules.<lb/>
Numa desired to know what founder built<lb/>
a Grecian city on Italian shores.<lb/>
One of the old inhabitants, who was well<lb/>
acquainted with past history, replied:<lb/>

    
“Rich in Iberian herds, the son of Jove<lb/>
turned from the ocean and with favoring wind<lb/>
'Tis said he landed on Lacinian shores.<lb/>
And, while the herd strayed in the tender grass,<lb/>
he visited the house, the friendly home,<lb/>
of far-famed Croton. There he rested from<lb/>
his arduous labors. At the time of his<lb/>
departure, he said, ‘Here in future days<lb/>
shall be a city of your numerous race.’<lb/>
The passing years have proved the promise true,<lb/>
for Myscelus, choosing that site, marked out<lb/>
a city's walls. Argive Alemon's son,<lb/>
of all men in his generation, he<lb/>
was most acceptable to the heavenly gods.<lb/>
Bending over him once at dawn, while he<lb/>
was overwhelmed with drowsiness of sleep,<lb/>
the huge club-bearer Hercules addressed<lb/>
him thus: ‘Come now, desert your native shores.<lb/>
Go quickly to the pebbly flowing stream<lb/>
of distant Aesar.’ And he threatened ill<lb/>
in fearful words, unless he should obey.<lb/>

    
“Sleep and the god departed instantly.<lb/>
Alemon's son, arising from his couch,<lb/>
pondered his recent vision thoughtfully,<lb/>
with his conclusions at cross purposes.—<lb/>
the god commanded him to quit that land,<lb/>
the laws forbade departure, threatening death<lb/>
to all who sought to leave their native land.<lb/>

    
“The brilliant Sun had hidden in the sea<lb/>
his shining head, and darkest Night had then<lb/>
put forth her starry face; and at that time<lb/>
it seemed as if the same god Hercules<lb/>
was present and repeating his commands,<lb/>
threatening still more and graver penalties,<lb/>
if he should fail to obey. Now sore afraid<lb/>
he set about to move his household gods<lb/>
to a new settlement, but rumors then<lb/>
followed him through the city, and he was<lb/>
accused of holding statutes in contempt.<lb/>

    
“The accusation hardly had been made<lb/>
when his offense was evidently proved,<lb/>
even without a witness. Then he raised<lb/>
his face and hands up to the gods above<lb/>
and suppliant in neglected garb, exclaimed,<lb/>
‘Oh mighty Hercules, for whom alone <lb/>
the twice six labors gave the privilege<lb/>
of heavenly residence, give me your aid,<lb/>
for you were the true cause of my offence.’<lb/>

    
“It was an ancient custom of that land<lb/>
to vote with chosen pebbles, white and black.<lb/>
The white absolved, the black condemned the man.<lb/>
And so that day the fateful votes were given—:<lb/>
all cast into the cruel urn were black!<lb/>
Soon as that urn inverted poured forth all<lb/>
the pebbles to be counted, every one<lb/>
was changed completely from its black to white,<lb/>
and so the vote adjudged him innocent.<lb/>
By that most fortunate aid of Hercules<lb/>
he was exempted from the country's law.<lb/>

    
“Myscelus, breathing thanks to Hercules,<lb/>
with favoring wind sailed on the Ionian sea,<lb/>
past Sallentine Neretum, Sybaris,<lb/>
Spartan Tarentum, and the Sirine Bay,<lb/>
Crimisa, and on beyond the Iapygian fields.<lb/>
Then, skirting shores which face these lands, he found<lb/>
the place foretold the river Aesar's mouth,<lb/>
and found not far away a burial mound<lb/>
which covered with its soil the hallowed bones<lb/>
of Croton.—There, upon the appointed land,<lb/>
he built up walls—and he conferred the name<lb/>
of Croton, who was there entombed, on his<lb/>
new city, which has ever since been called<lb/>
Crotona.” By tradition it is known<lb/>
such strange deeds caused that city to be built,<lb/>
by men of Greece upon the Italian coast.<lb/>


Pythagoras.
PYTHAGORAS TEACHES HIS PHILOSOPHY

Here lived a man, by birth a Samian.<lb/>
He had fled from Samos and the ruling class,<lb/>
a voluntary exile, for his hate<lb/>
against all tyranny. He had the gift<lb/>
of holding mental converse with the gods,<lb/>
who live far distant in the highth of heaven;<lb/>
and all that Nature has denied to man<lb/>
and human vision, he reviewed with eyes<lb/>
of his enlightened soul. And, when he had<lb/>
examined all things in his careful mind<lb/>
with watchful study, he released his thoughts<lb/>
to knowledge of the public.<lb/>

    
He would speak<lb/>
to crowds of people, silent and amazed,<lb/>
while he revealed to them the origin<lb/>
of this vast universe, the cause of things,<lb/>
what is nature, what a god, whence came the snow,<lb/>
the cause of lightning—was it Jupiter<lb/>
or did the winds, that thundered when the cloud<lb/>
was rent asunder, cause the lightning flash?<lb/>
What shook the earth, what laws controlled the stars<lb/>
as they were moved—and every hidden thing<lb/>
he was the first man to forbid the use<lb/>
of any animal's flesh as human food,<lb/>
he was the first to speak with learned lips,<lb/>
though not believed in this, exhorting them.—<lb/>

    
“No, mortals,” he would say, “Do not permit<lb/>
pollution of your bodies with such food,<lb/>
for there are grain and good fruits which bear down<lb/>
the branches by their weight, and ripened grapes<lb/>
upon the vines, and herbs—those sweet by nature<lb/>
and those which will grow tender and mellow with<lb/>
a fire, and flowing milk is not denied,<lb/>
nor honey, redolent of blossoming thyme.<lb/>

    
“The lavish Earth yields rich and healthful food<lb/>
affording dainties without slaughter, death,<lb/>
and bloodshed. Dull beasts delight to satisfy<lb/>
their hunger with torn flesh; and yet not all:<lb/>
horses and sheep and cattle live on grass.<lb/>
But all the savage animals—the fierce<lb/>
Armenian tigers and ferocious lions,<lb/>
and bears, together with the roving wolves—<lb/>
delight in viands reeking with warm blood.<lb/>

    
“Oh, ponder a moment such a monstrous crime—<lb/>
vitals in vitals gorged, one greedy body<lb/>
fattening with plunder of another's flesh,<lb/>
a living being fed on another's life!<lb/>
In that abundance, which our Earth, the best<lb/>
of mothers, will afford have you no joy,<lb/>
unless your savage teeth can gnaw<lb/>
the piteous flesh of some flayed animal<lb/>
to reenact the Cyclopean crime?<lb/>
And can you not appease the hungry void—<lb/>
the perverted craving of a stomach's greed,<lb/>
unless you first destroy another life?<lb/>

    
“That age of old time which is given the name<lb/>
of ‘Golden,’ was so blest in fruit of trees,<lb/>
and in the good herbs which the earth produced <lb/>
that it never would pollute the mouth with blood.<lb/>
The birds then safely moved their wings in air,<lb/>
the timid hares would wander in the fields<lb/>
with no fear, and their own credulity<lb/>
had not suspended fishes from the hook.<lb/>
All life was safe from treacherous wiles,<lb/>
fearing no injury, a peaceful world.<lb/>

    
“After that time some one of ill advice<lb/>
(it does not matter who it might have been)<lb/>
envied the ways of lions and gulped into<lb/>
his greedy paunch stuff from a carcass vile.<lb/>
He opened the foul paths of wickedness.<lb/>
It may be that in killing beasts of prey<lb/>
our steel was for the first time warmed with blood.<lb/>
And that could be defended, for I hold<lb/>
that predatory creatures which attempt<lb/>
destruction of mankind, are put to death<lb/>
without evasion of the sacred laws:<lb/>
but, though with justice they are put to death,<lb/>
that cannot be a cause for eating them.<lb/>

    
“This wickedness went further; and the sow<lb/>
was thought to have deserved death as the first<lb/>
of victims, for with her long turned-up snout<lb/>
she spoiled the good hope of a harvest year.<lb/>
The ravenous goat, that gnawed a sprouting vine,<lb/>
was led for slaughter to the altar fires<lb/>
of angry Bacchus. It was their own fault<lb/>
that surely caused the ruin of those two.<lb/>

    
“But why have sheep deserved sad destiny,<lb/>
harmless and useful for the good of man<lb/>
with nectar in full udders? Their soft wool<lb/>
affords the warmest coverings for our use,<lb/>
their life and not their death would help us more.<lb/>
Why have the oxen of the field deserved<lb/>
a sad end—innocent, without deceit,<lb/>
and harmless, without guile, born to endure<lb/>
hard labor? Without gratitude is he,<lb/>
unworthy of the gift of harvest fields,<lb/>
who, after he relieved his worker from<lb/>
weight of the curving plow could butcher him,<lb/>
could sever with an axe that toil worn neck,<lb/>
by which so often with hard work the ground<lb/>
had been turned up, so many harvests reared.<lb/>
For some, even crimes like these are not enough,<lb/>
they have imputed to the gods themselves<lb/>
abomination—they believe a god<lb/>
in heaven above, rejoices at the death<lb/>
of a laborious ox.<lb/>

    
“A victim free<lb/>
of blemish and most beautiful in form<lb/>
(perfection brings destruction) is adorned<lb/>
with garlands and with gilded horns before<lb/>
the altar. In his ignorance he hears<lb/>
one praying, and he sees the very grain<lb/>
he labored to produce, fixed on his head<lb/>
between the horns, and felled, he stains with blood<lb/>
the knife which just before he may have seen<lb/>
reflected in clear water. Instantly<lb/>
they snatch out entrails from his throbbing form,<lb/>
and seek in them intentions of the gods.<lb/>
Then, in your lust for a forbidden food<lb/>
you will presume to batten on his flesh,<lb/>
O race of mortals! Do not eat such food!<lb/>
Give your attention to my serious words;<lb/>
and, when you next present the slaughtered flesh<lb/>
of oxen to your palates, know and feel<lb/>
that you gnaw your fellow tillers of the soil.<lb/>

    
“And, since a god impels me to speak out,<lb/>
I will obey the god who urges me,<lb/>
and will disclose to you the heavens above,<lb/>
and I will even reveal the oracles<lb/>
of the Divine Will. I will sing to you<lb/>
of things most wonderful, which never were<lb/>
investigated by the intellects<lb/>
of ancient times and things which have been long<lb/>
concealed from man. In fancy I delight<lb/>
to float among the stars or take my stand<lb/>
on mighty Atlas' shoulders, and to look<lb/>
afar down on men wandering here and there—<lb/>
afraid in life yet dreading unknown death,<lb/>
and in these words exhort them and reveal<lb/>
the sequence of events ordained by fate!<lb/>


    
“O sad humanity! Why do you fear<lb/>
alarms of icy death, afraid of Styx,<lb/>
fearful of moving shadows and empty names—<lb/>
of subjects harped on by the poets' tales,<lb/>
the fabled perils of a fancied life?<lb/>
Whether the funeral pile consumes your flesh<lb/>
with hot flames, or old age dissolves it with<lb/>
a gradual wasting power, be well assured<lb/>
the body cannot meet with further ill.<lb/>
And souls are all exempt from power of death.<lb/>
When they have left their first corporeal home,<lb/>
they always find and live in newer homes.<lb/>

    
“I can declare, for I remember well,<lb/>
that in the days of the great Trojan War,<lb/>
I was Euphorbus, son of Panthous.<lb/>
In my opposing breast was planted then<lb/>
the heavy spear-point of the younger son<lb/>
of Atreus. Not long past I recognised<lb/>
the shield, once burden of my left arm, where<lb/>
it hung in Juno's temple at ancient Argos,<lb/>
the realm of Abas. Everything must change:<lb/>
but nothing perishes. The moving soul<lb/>
may wander, coming from that spot to this,<lb/>
from this to that—in changed possession live<lb/>
in any limbs whatever. It may pass<lb/>
from beasts to human bodies, and again<lb/>
to those of beasts. The soul will never die,<lb/>
in the long lapse of time. As pliant wax<lb/>
is moulded to new forms and does not stay<lb/>
as it has been nor keep the self same form<lb/>
yet is the selfsame wax, be well assured<lb/>
the soul is always the same spirit, though<lb/>
it passes into different forms. Therefore,<lb/>
that natural love may not be vanquished by<lb/>
unnatural craving of the appetite,<lb/>
I warn you, stop expelling kindred souls<lb/>
by deeds abhorrent as cold murder.—Let<lb/>
not blood be nourished with its kindred blood!<lb/>

    
“Since I am launched into the open sea<lb/>
and I have given my full sails to the wind,<lb/>
nothing in all the world remains unchanged.<lb/>
All things are in a state of flux, all shapes<lb/>
receive a changing nature. Time itself<lb/>
glides on with constant motion, ever as<lb/>
a flowing river. Neither river nor<lb/>
the fleeting hour can stop its constant course.<lb/>
But, as each wave drives on a wave, as each<lb/>
is pressed by that which follows, and must press<lb/>
on that before it, so the moments fly,<lb/>
and others follow, so they are renewed.<lb/>
The moment which moved on before is past,<lb/>
and that which was not, now exists in Time,<lb/>
and every one comes, goes, and is replaced.<lb/>

    
“You see how night glides by and then proceeds<lb/>
on to the dawn, then brilliant light of day<lb/>
succeeds the dark night. There is not the same<lb/>
appearance in the heavens,: when all things<lb/>
for weariness are resting in vast night,<lb/>
as when bright Lucifer rides his white steed.<lb/>
And only think of that most glorious change,<lb/>
when loved Aurora, Pallas' daughter, comes<lb/>
before the day and tints the world, almost<lb/>
delivered to bright Phoebus. Even the disk<lb/>
of that god, rising from beneath the earth,<lb/>
is of a ruddy color in the dawn<lb/>
and ruddy when concealed beneath the world.<lb/>
When highest, it is a most brilliant white,<lb/>
for there the ether is quite purified,<lb/>
and far away avoids infection from<lb/>
impurities of earth. Diana's form<lb/>
at night remains not equal nor the same!<lb/>
'Tis less today than it will be tomorrow,<lb/>
if she is waxing; greater, if she wanes.<lb/>

    
“Yes, do you not see how the year moves through<lb/>
four seasons, imitating human life:<lb/>
in early Spring it has a nursling's ways<lb/>
resembling infancy, for at that time<lb/>
the blade is shooting and devoid of strength.<lb/>
Its flaccid substance swelling gives delight,<lb/>
to every watching husbandman, alive<lb/>
in expectation. Then all things are rich<lb/>
in blossom, and the genial meadow smiles<lb/>
with tints of blooming flowers; but not as yet<lb/>
is there a sign of vigor in the leaves.<lb/>

    
“The year now waxing stronger, after Spring<lb/>
it passes into Summer, and its youth<lb/>
becomes robust. Indeed of all the year<lb/>
the Summer is most vigorous and most<lb/>
abounds with glowing and life-giving warmth.<lb/>

    
“Autumn then follows, and, the vim of life<lb/>
removed, that ripe and mellow time succeeds<lb/>
between youth and old age, and a few white hairs<lb/>
are sprinkled here and there upon his brow.<lb/>

    
“Then aged Winter with his tremulous step<lb/>
follows, repulsive, strips of graceful locks<lb/>
or white with those he has retained so long.<lb/>

    
“Our bodies also, always change unceasingly:<lb/>
we are not now what we were yesterday<lb/>
or we shall be tomorrow. And there was<lb/>
a time when we were only seeds of man,<lb/>
mere hopes that lived within a mother's womb.<lb/>
But Nature changed us with her skilfull touch,<lb/>
determined that our bodies should not be<lb/>
held in such narrow room, below the entrails<lb/>
in our distended parent; and in time<lb/>
she brought us forth into the vacant air.<lb/>

    
“Brought into light, the helpless infant lies.<lb/>
Then on all fours he lifts his body up,<lb/>
feeling his way, like any young wild beast,<lb/>
and then by slow degrees he stands upright,<lb/>
weak-kneed and trembling, steadied by support<lb/>
of some convenient prop. And soon more strong<lb/>
and swift he passes through the hours of youth,<lb/>
and, when the years of middle age are past,<lb/>
slides down the steep path of declining age.<lb/>

    
“This undermines him and destroys the strength<lb/>
of former years: and Milon, now grown old,<lb/>
weeps, when he sees his arms, which once were firm<lb/>
with muscles big as those of Hercules,<lb/>
hang flabby at his side: and Helen weeps,<lb/>
when in the glass she sees her wrinkled face,<lb/>
and wonders why two heroes fell in love<lb/>
and carried her away.—O Time,<lb/>
devourer of all things, and envious Age,<lb/>
together you destroy all that exists<lb/>
and, slowly gnawing, bring on lingering death.<lb/>

    
“Yes, even things which we call elements,<lb/>
do not endure. Now listen well to me,<lb/>
and I will show the ways in which they change.<lb/>

    
“The everlasting universe contains<lb/>
four elemental parts. And two of these<lb/>
are heavy—earth and water—and are borne<lb/>
downwards by weight. The other two devoid<lb/>
of weight, are air and—even lighter—fire:<lb/>
and, if these two are not constrained, they seek<lb/>
the higher regions. These four elements,<lb/>
though far apart in space, are all derived<lb/>
from one another. Earth dissolves<lb/>
as flowing water! Water, thinned still more,<lb/>
departs as wind and air; and the light air,<lb/>
still losing weight, sparkles on high as fire.<lb/>
But they return, along their former way:<lb/>
the fire, assuming weight, is changed to air;<lb/>
and then, more dense, that air is changed again<lb/>
to water; and that water, still more dense,<lb/>
compacts itself again as primal earth.<lb/>


    
“Nothing retains the form that seems its own,<lb/>
and Nature, the renewer of all things,<lb/>
continually changes every form<lb/>
into some other shape. Believe my word,<lb/>
in all this universe of vast extent,<lb/>
not one thing ever perished. All have changed<lb/>
appearance. Men say a certain thing is born,<lb/>
if it takes a different form from what it had;<lb/>
and yet they say, that certain thing has died,<lb/>
if it no longer keeps the self same shape.<lb/>
Though distant things move near, and near things far,<lb/>
always the sum of all things is unchanged.<lb/>

    
“For my part, I cannot believe a thing<lb/>
remains long under the same form unchanged.<lb/>
Look at the change of times from gold to iron,:<lb/>
look at the change in places. I have seen<lb/>
what had been solid earth become salt waves,<lb/>
and I have seen dry land made from the deep;<lb/>
and, far away from ocean, sea-shells strewn,<lb/>
and on the mountain-tops old anchors found.<lb/>
Water has made that which was once a plain<lb/>
into a valley, and the mountain has<lb/>
been levelled by the floods down to a plain.<lb/>
A former marshland is now parched dry sand,<lb/>
and places which endured severest drought<lb/>
are wet with standing pools. Here Nature has<lb/>
opened fresh springs, but there has shut them up;<lb/>
rivers aroused by ancient earthquakes have<lb/>
rushed out or vanished, as they lost their depth.<lb/>

    
“So, when the Lycus has been swallowed by<lb/>
a chasm in the earth, it rushes forth<lb/>
at a distance and is reborn a different stream.<lb/>
The Erasinus now flows down into a cave,<lb/>
now runs beneath the ground a darkened course,<lb/>
then rises lordly in the Argolic fields.<lb/>
They say the Mysus, wearied of his spring<lb/>
and of his former banks, appears elsewhere<lb/>
and takes another name, the Caicus.<lb/>

    
“The Amenanus in Sicilian sands<lb/>
now smoothly rolling, at another time<lb/>
is quenched, because its fountain springs are dry.<lb/>
The water of the Anigros formerly<lb/>
was used for drinking, but it pours out now<lb/>
foul water which you would decline to touch,<lb/>
because (unless all credit is denied<lb/>
to poets) long ago the Centaurs, those<lb/>
strange mortals double-limbed, bathed in the stream<lb/>
wounds which club-bearing Hercules had made<lb/>
with his strong bow.—Yes, does not Hypanis<lb/>
descending fresh from mountains of Sarmatia,<lb/>
become embittered with the taste of salt?<lb/>

    
“Antissa, Pharos, and Phoenician Tyre,<lb/>
were once surrounded by the wavy sea:<lb/>
they are not islands now. Long years ago<lb/>
Leucas was mainland, if we can believe<lb/>
what the old timers there will tell, but now<lb/>
the waves sweep round it. Zancle was a part<lb/>
of Italy, until the sea cut off<lb/>
the neighboring land with strong waves in between.<lb/>
Should you seek Helice and Buris, those<lb/>
two cities of Achaea, you will find<lb/>
them underneath the waves, where sailors point<lb/>
to sloping roofs and streets in the clear deep.<lb/>

    
“Near Pittheaan Troezen a steep, high hill,<lb/>
quite bare of trees, was once a level plain,<lb/>
but now is a hill, for (dreadful even to tell)<lb/>
the raging power of winds, long pent in deep,<lb/>
dark caverns, tried to find a proper vent,<lb/>
long struggling to attain free sky.<lb/>
Finding no opening from the prison-caves,<lb/>
imperious to their force, they raised the earth,<lb/>
exactly as pent air breathed from the mouth<lb/>
inflates a bladder, or the bottle-hides<lb/>
stripped off the two-horned goats. The swollen earth<lb/>
remained on that spot and has ever since<lb/>
appearance of a high hill hardened by<lb/>
the flight of time.<lb/>

    
“Of many strange events<lb/>
that I have heard and known, I will add a few.<lb/>
Why, does not water give and take strange forms?<lb/>
Your wave, O horned Ammon, will turn cold<lb/>
at mid-day, but is always mild and warm<lb/>
at sun-rise and at sun-set. I have heard<lb/>
that Athamanians kindle wood, if they<lb/>
pour water on it, when the waning moon<lb/>
has shrunk away into her smallest orb.<lb/>
The people of Ciconia have a stream<lb/>
which turns the drinker's entrails into stone,<lb/>
which changes into marble all it raves.<lb/>
The Achaean Crathis and the Sybaris,<lb/>
which flow not far from here, will turn the hair<lb/>
to something like clear amber or bright gold.<lb/>

    
“What is more wonderful, there are some waters<lb/>
which change not only bodies but the minds:<lb/>
who has no knowledge of the Salmacis<lb/>
and of its ill famed waves? Who has not<lb/>
heard of the lakes of Aethiopia:<lb/>
how those who drink of them go raving mad<lb/>
or fall in a deep sleep, most wonderful<lb/>
in heaviness. Whoever quenches thirst<lb/>
from the Clitorian spring will hate all wine,<lb/>
and soberly secure great pleasure from<lb/>
pure water. Either that spring has a power<lb/>
the opposite of wine-heat, or perhaps<lb/>
as natives tell us, after the famed son<lb/>
of Amythaon by his charms and herbs,<lb/>
delivered from their base insanity<lb/>
the stricken Proetides, he threw the rest<lb/>
of his mind healing herbs into the spring,<lb/>
where hatred of all wine has since remained.<lb/>
Unlike in nature flows another stream<lb/>
of the country, called Lyncestius: everyone<lb/>
who drinks of it, even with most temperate care,<lb/>
will reel, as if he had drunk unmixed wine.<lb/>
In Arcadia is a place, called Pheneos<lb/>
by men of old, which is mistrusted for<lb/>
the twofold nature of its waters. Stand<lb/>
in dread of them at night; if drunk at night,<lb/>
they harm you, but in daytime they will do<lb/>
no harm at all.
So lakes and rivers have<lb/>
now this, now that effect.<lb/>

    
“Ortygia once<lb/>
moved like a ship that drifts among the waves.<lb/>
Now it is fixed. The Argo was in dread<lb/>
of the Symplegades, which moved apart<lb/>
with waves in-rushing. Now immovable<lb/>
they stand, resisting the attack of winds.<lb/>

    
“Aetna, which burns with sulphur furnaces,<lb/>
will not be always concentrated fire,<lb/>
nor was it always fiery. If the earth<lb/>
is like an animal and is alive<lb/>
and breathes out flame at many openings,<lb/>
then it can change these many passages<lb/>
used for its breathing and, when it is moved,<lb/>
may close these caverns as it opens up<lb/>
some others. Or if rushing winds are penned<lb/>
in deepest caverns, and they drive great stones<lb/>
against the rock, and substances which have<lb/>
the properties of flame and fire are made<lb/>
by those concussions; when the winds are calmed<lb/>
the caverns will, of course, be cool again.<lb/>

    
“Or if some black bitumen catches fire<lb/>
or yellow sulphur burns with little smoke,<lb/>
then surely, when the ground no longer gives<lb/>
such food and oily nutriment for flames<lb/>
and they in time have ravined all their store,<lb/>
their greedy nature soon will pine with death—<lb/>
it will not bear such famine but depart<lb/>
and, when deserted, will desert the place.<lb/>

    
“'Tis said that Hyperboreans of Pallene<lb/>
can cover all their bodies with light plumes<lb/>
by plunging nine times in Minerva's marsh.<lb/>
But I cannot believe another tale:<lb/>
that Scythian women get a like result<lb/>
by having poison sprinkled on their limbs.<lb/>

    
“If we give any credit to the things<lb/>
proved by experience, we can surely know<lb/>
whatever bodies are decayed by time<lb/>
or by dissolving heat are by such means<lb/>
changed into tiny animals—Come now,<lb/>
bury choice bullocks killed for sacrifice,<lb/>
and it is well known by experience<lb/>
that the flower-gathering bees are so produced,<lb/>
miraculous, from entrails putrefied.<lb/>
These, like the faithful animals from which<lb/>
they were produced, inhabit the green fields,<lb/>
delight in toil, and labor for reward.<lb/>

    
“The warlike steed, when buried in the ground,<lb/>
is a known source of hornets. If you cut<lb/>
the bending claws off from the sea-shore crab<lb/>
and bury the remainder in the earth,<lb/>
a scorpion will come forth from the dead crab<lb/>
buried there, threatening with its crooked tail.<lb/>

    
“The worms which cover leaves with their white threads,<lb/>
a thing observable by husbandmen,<lb/>
will change themselves to funeral butterflies.<lb/>
Mud holds the seeds that generate green frogs,<lb/>
at first producing tadpoles with no feet,<lb/>
and soon it gives them legs adapted for<lb/>
their swimming, and, so they may be as well<lb/>
adapted to good leaping, their hind legs<lb/>
are longer than the fore-legs. The mother bear<lb/>
does not bring forth a cub but a limp mass<lb/>
of flesh that hardly can be called alive.<lb/>
By licking it the mother forms the limbs,<lb/>
and brings it to a shape just like her own.<lb/>

    
“Do not the offspring of the honey bees,<lb/>
concealed in cells hexagonal, at first<lb/>
get life with no limbs, and assume in time<lb/>
both feet and wings? Unless the fact were known,<lb/>
could anyone suppose it possible<lb/>
that Juno's bird, whose tail is bright with stars;<lb/>
the eagle, armor-bearer of high Jove;<lb/>
the doves of Cytherea; and all birds<lb/>
emerge from the middle part of eggs?<lb/>
And some believe the human marrow turns<lb/>
into a serpent when the spine at length<lb/>
has putrefied in the closed sepulchre.<lb/>

    
“Now these I named derive their origin<lb/>
from other living forms. There is one bird<lb/>
which reproduces and renews itself:<lb/>
the Assyrians gave this bird his name—the Phoenix.<lb/>
He does not live either on grain or herbs,<lb/>
but only on small drops of frankincense<lb/>
and juices of amomum. When this bird<lb/>
completes a full five centuries of life<lb/>
straightway with talons and with shining beak<lb/>
he builds a nest among palm branches, where<lb/>
they join to form the palm tree's waving top.<lb/>

    
“As soon as he has strewn in this new nest<lb/>
the cassia bark and ears of sweet spikenard,<lb/>
and some bruised cinnamon with yellow myrrh,<lb/>
he lies down on it and refuses life<lb/>
among those dreamful odors.—And they say<lb/>
that from the body of the dying bird<lb/>
is reproduced a little Phoenix which<lb/>
is destined to live just as many years.<lb/>

    
“When time has given to him sufficient strength<lb/>
and he is able to sustain the weight,<lb/>
he lifts the nest up from the lofty tree<lb/>
and dutifully carries from that place<lb/>
his cradle and the parent's sepulchre.<lb/>
As soon as he has reached through yielding air<lb/>
the city of Hyperion, he will lay<lb/>
the burden just before the sacred doors<lb/>
within the temple of Hyperion.<lb/>

    
“But, if we wonder at strange things like these,<lb/>
we ought to wonder also, when we learn<lb/>
that a hyena has a change of sex:<lb/>
the female, quitting her embracing male,<lb/>
herself becomes a male.—That animal<lb/>
which feeds upon the winds and air, at once<lb/>
assumes with contact any color touched.<lb/>

    
“Conquered India gave to the vine crowned Bacchus<lb/>
lynxes, whose urine turns, they say to stones,<lb/>
hardening in air. So coral, too, as soon<lb/>
as it has risen above the sea, turns hard.<lb/>
Below the waves it was a tender plant.<lb/>

    
“The day will fail me; Phoebus will have bathed<lb/>
his panting horses in the deep sea waves,<lb/>
before I can include in my discourse<lb/>
the myriad things transforming to new shapes.<lb/>
In lapse of time we see the nations change;<lb/>
some grow in power, some wane. Troy was once great<lb/>
in riches and in men—so great she could<lb/>
for ten unequalled years afford much blood;<lb/>
now she lies low and offers to our gaze<lb/>
but ancient ruins and, instead of wealth,<lb/>
ancestral tombs. Sparta was famous once<lb/>
and great Mycenae was most flourishing.<lb/>
And Cecrops' citadel and Amphion's shone<lb/>
in ancient power. Sparta is nothing now<lb/>
save barren ground, the proud Mycenae fell,<lb/>
what is the Thebes of storied Oedipus<lb/>
except a name? And of Pandion's Athens<lb/>
what now remains beyond the name?<lb/>

    
“Reports come to me that Dardanian Rome<lb/>
is rising, and beside the Tiber's waves,<lb/>
whose springs are high in the Apennines, is laying<lb/>
her deep foundations. So in her growth<lb/>
her form is changing, and one day she will<lb/>
be the sole mistress of the boundless world.<lb/>

    
“They say that soothsayers and that oracles,<lb/>
revealers of our destiny, declare<lb/>
this fate, and, if I recollect it right,<lb/>
Helenus, son of Priam, prophesied<lb/>
unto Aeneas, when he was in doubt<lb/>
of safety and lamenting for the state <lb/>
of Troy, about to fall, ‘O, son of a goddess,<lb/>
if you yourself, will fully understand<lb/>
this prophecy now surging in my mind<lb/>
Troy shall not, while you are preserved to life<lb/>
fall utterly. Flames and the sword shall give <lb/>
you passage. You shall go and bear away<lb/>
Pergama, ruined; till a foreign soil,<lb/>
more friendly to you than your native land,<lb/>
shall be the lot of Troy and of yourself.<lb/>

    
“Even now I know it is decreed by Fate<lb/>
that our posterity, born far from Troy,<lb/>
will build a city greater than exists,<lb/>
or ever will exist, or ever has<lb/>
been seen in former times. Through a long lapse<lb/>
of ages other noted men shall make<lb/>
it strong, but one of the race of Iulus;<lb/>
shall make it the great mistress of the world.<lb/>
After the earth has thoroughly enjoyed <lb/>
his glorious life, aetherial abodes <lb/>
shall gain him, and immortal heaven shall be<lb/>
his destiny.’
Such was the prophesy<lb/>
of Helenus, when great Aeneas took<lb/>
away his guardian deities, and I<lb/>
rejoice to see my kindred walls rise high<lb/>
and realize how much the Trojans won<lb/>
by that resounding victory of the Greeks!<lb/>

    
“But, that we may not range afar with steeds<lb/>
forgetful of the goal, the heavens and all<lb/>
beneath them and the earth and everything<lb/>
upon it change in form. We likewise change,<lb/>
who are a portion of the universe,<lb/>
and, since we are not only things of flesh<lb/>
but winged souls as well, we may be doomed<lb/>
to enter into beasts as our abode;<lb/>
and even to be hidden in the breasts<lb/>
of cattle. Therefore, should we not allow<lb/>
these bodies to be safe which may contain<lb/>
the souls of parents, brothers, or of those<lb/>
allied to us by kinship or of men<lb/>
at least, who should be saved from every harm?<lb/>
Let us not gorge down a Thyestean feast!<lb/>

    
“How greatly does a man disgrace himself,<lb/>
how impiously does he prepare himself<lb/>
for shedding human blood, who with u knife<lb/>
cuts the calf's throat and offers a deaf ear<lb/>
to its death-longings! who can kill the kid<lb/>
while it is sending forth heart rending cries<lb/>
like those of a dear child; or who can feed<lb/>
upon the bird which he has given food.<lb/>
How little do such deeds as these fall short<lb/>
of actual murder? Yes, where will they lead?<lb/>

    
“Let the ox plough, or let him owe his death<lb/>
to weight of years; and let the sheep give us<lb/>
defence against the cold of Boreas;<lb/>
and let the well-fed she-goats give to man<lb/>
their udders for the pressure of kind hands.<lb/>

    
“Away with cruel nets and springs and snares<lb/>
and fraudulent contrivances: deceive<lb/>
not birds with bird-limed twigs: do not deceive<lb/>
the trusting deer with dreaded feather foils:<lb/>
do not conceal barbed hooks with treacherous bait:<lb/>
if any beast is harmful, take his life,<lb/>
but, even so, let killing be enough.<lb/>
Taste not his flesh, but look for harmless food!”<lb/>


Egeria. Hippolytus.
EGERIA CHANGED INTO A FOUNTAIN

They say that Numa with a mind well taught<lb/>
by these and other precepts traveled back<lb/>
to his own land and, being urged again,<lb/>
assumed the guidance of the Latin state.<lb/>
Blest with a nymph as consort, blest also with<lb/>
the Muses for his guides, he taught the rites<lb/>
of sacrifice and trained in arts of peace<lb/>
a race accustomed long to savage war.<lb/>
When, ripe in years, he ended reign and life,<lb/>
the Latin matrons, the fathers of the state,<lb/>
and all the people wept for Numa's death.<lb/>
For the nymph, his widow, had withdrawn from Rome,<lb/>
concealed within the thick groves of the vale<lb/>
Aricia, where with groans and wailing she<lb/>
disturbed the holy rites of Cynthia,<lb/>
established by Orestes. Ah! how often<lb/>
nymphs of the grove and lake entreated her<lb/>
to cease and offered her consoling words.<lb/>
How often the son of Theseus said to her<lb/>
“Control your sorrow; surely your sad lot<lb/>
is not the only one; consider now<lb/>
the like calamities by others borne,<lb/>
and you can bear your sorrow. To my grief<lb/>
my own disaster was far worse than yours.<lb/>
At least it can afford you comfort now.<lb/>


“Is it not true, discourse has reached yours ears<lb/>
that one Hippolytus met with his death<lb/>
through the credulity of his loved sire,<lb/>
deceived by a stepmother's wicked art?<lb/>
It will amaze you much, and I may fail <lb/>
to prove what I declare, but I am he!<lb/>
Long since the daughter of Pasiphae<lb/>
tempted me to defile my father's bed<lb/>
and, failing, feigned that I had wished to do<lb/>
what she herself had wished. Perverting truth—<lb/>
either through fear of some discovery<lb/>
or else through spite at her deserved repulse—<lb/>
she charged me with attempting the foul crime.<lb/>

    
“Though I was guiltless of all wrong,<lb/>
my father banished me and, while I was<lb/>
departing, laid on me a mortal curse.<lb/>
Towards Pittheus and Troezen I fled aghast,<lb/>
guiding the swift chariot near the shore<lb/>
of the Corinthian Gulf, when all at once<lb/>
the sea rose up and seemed to arch itself<lb/>
and lift high as a white topped mountain height,<lb/>
make bellowings, and open at the crest.<lb/>
Then through the parting waves a horned bull<lb/>
emerged with head and breast into the wind, <lb/>
spouting white foam from his nostrils and his mouth.<lb/>


“The hearts of my attendants quailed with fear,<lb/>
yet I unfrightened thought but of my exile.<lb/>
Then my fierce horses turned their necks to face<lb/>
the waters, and with ears erect they quaked<lb/>
before the monster shape, they dashed in flight<lb/>
along the rock strewn ground below the cliff.<lb/>
I struggled, but with unavailing hand,<lb/>
to use the reins now covered with white foam;<lb/>
and throwing myself back, pulled on the thongs<lb/>
with weight and strength. Such effort might have checked<lb/>
the madness of my steeds, had not a wheel,<lb/>
striking the hub on a projecting stump,<lb/>
been shattered and hurled in fragments from the axle.<lb/>

    
“I was thrown forward from my chariot<lb/>
and with the reins entwined about my legs.<lb/>
My palpitating entrails could be seen<lb/>
dragged on, my sinews fastened on a stump.<lb/>
My torn legs followed, but a part<lb/>
remained behind me, caught by various snags.<lb/>
The breaking bones gave out a crackling noise,<lb/>
my tortured spirit soon had fled away,<lb/>
no part of the torn body could be known—<lb/>
all that was left was only one crushed wound—<lb/>
how can, how dare you, nymph, compare your ills<lb/>
to my disaster?<lb/>

    
“I saw the Lower World<lb/>
deprived of light: and I have bathed my flesh,<lb/>
so tortured, in the waves of Phlegethon.<lb/>
Life could not have been given again to me,<lb/>
but through the remedies Apollo's son<lb/>
applied to me. After my life returned—<lb/>
by potent herbs and the Paeonian aid,<lb/>
despite the will of Pluto—Cynthia then<lb/>
threw heavy clouds around that I might not<lb/>
be seen and cause men envy by new life:<lb/>
and that she might be sure my life was safe<lb/>
she made me seem an old man; and she changed<lb/>
me so that I could not be recognized.<lb/>

    
“A long time she debated whether she<lb/>
would give me Crete or Delos for my home.<lb/>
Delos and Crete abandoned, she then brought<lb/>
me here, and at the same time ordered me<lb/>
to lay aside my former name—one which<lb/>
when mentioned would remind me of my steeds.<lb/>
She said to me, ‘You were Hippolytus,<lb/>
but now instead you shall be Virbius.’<lb/>
And from that time I have inhabited<lb/>
this grove; and, as one of the lesser gods,<lb/>
I live concealed and numbered in her train.”<lb/>

    
The grief of others could not ease the woe<lb/>
of sad Egeria, and she laid herself<lb/>
down at a mountain's foot, dissolved in tears,<lb/>
till moved by pity for her faithful sorrow,<lb/>
Diana changed her body to a spring,<lb/>
her limbs into a clear continual stream.<lb/>


Tages. Cipus.
CIPPUS WITH HORNS

This wonderful event surprised the nymphs,<lb/>
and filled Hippolytus with wonder, just<lb/>
as great as when the Etrurian ploughman saw<lb/>
a fate-revealing clod move of its own<lb/>
accord among the fields, while not a hand<lb/>
was touching it, till finally it took<lb/>
a human form, without the quality<lb/>
of clodded earth, and opened its new mouth<lb/>
and spoke, revealing future destinies.<lb/>
The natives called him Tages. He was the first<lb/>
who taught Etrurians to foretell events.<lb/>

    
They were astonished even as Romulus,<lb/>
when he observed the spear, which once had grown<lb/>
high on the Palatine, put out new leaves<lb/>
and stand with roots—not with the iron point<lb/>
which he had driven in. Not as a spear<lb/>
it then stood there, but as a rooted tree<lb/>
with limber twigs for many to admire<lb/>
while resting under that surprising shade.<lb/>

    
Or, as when Cippus first observed his horns<lb/>
in the clear stream (he truly saw them there).<lb/>
Believing he had seen a falsity,<lb/>
he often touched his forehead with his hand<lb/>
and, so returning, touched the thing he saw.<lb/>
Assured at last that he could trust his eyes,<lb/>
he stood entranced, as if he had returned<lb/>
victorious from the conquest of his foes:<lb/>
and, raising eyes and hands toward heaven, he cried,<lb/>
“You gods above! Whatever is foretold<lb/>
by this great prodigy, if it means good,<lb/>
then let it be auspicious to my land<lb/>
and to the inhabitants of Quirinus,—<lb/>
if ill, let that misfortune fall on me.”<lb/>

    
He made an offering at new altars, built<lb/>
of grassy thick green turf, with fragrant fires,<lb/>
presenting wine in bowls. And he took note<lb/>
of panting entrails from new-slaughtered sheep,<lb/>
to learn the meaning of the event for him.<lb/>

    
When an Etruscan seer examined them,<lb/>
he found the evidence of great events,<lb/>
as yet obscure, and, when he raised keen eyes<lb/>
up from the entrails to the horns of Cippus,<lb/>
“O king, all hail!” he cried, “For in future time<lb/>
this country and the Latin towers will live<lb/>
in homage to you, Cippus, and your horns.<lb/>
But you must promptly put aside delay;<lb/>
hasten to enter the wide open gates—<lb/>
the fates command you. Once received within<lb/>
the city, you shall be its chosen king<lb/>
and safely shall enjoy a lasting reign.”<lb/>

    
Cippus retreated, and he turned his grave<lb/>
eyes from the city's walls and said, “O far,<lb/>
O far away, the righteous gods should drive<lb/>
such omens from me! Better it would be<lb/>
that I should pass my life in exile than<lb/>
be seen a king throned in the capitol.”<lb/>

    
Such words he spoke and forthwith he convoked<lb/>
the people and the grave and honored Senate.<lb/>
But first he veiled his horns with laurel, which<lb/>
betokens peace. Then, standing on a mound<lb/>
raised by the valiant troops, he made a prayer<lb/>
after the ancient mode, and then he said,<lb/>
“There is one here who will be king, if you<lb/>
do not expel him from your city—I<lb/>
will show him to you surely by a sign;<lb/>
although I will not tell his name. He wears<lb/>
horns on his head. The augur prophecies<lb/>
that, if he enters this your city, he<lb/>
will give you laws as if you were his slaves.<lb/>

    
“He might have forced his way within your gates,<lb/>
for they stand open, but I have hindered him,<lb/>
although nobody is to him so close<lb/>
as I myself. Good Romans, then, forbid<lb/>
your city to this man; or, if you find<lb/>
that he deserves still worse, then bind him fast<lb/>
with heavy fetters; or else end your fears<lb/>
by knowledge of the destined tyrant's death.”<lb/>

    
As murmurs which arise among the groves<lb/>
of pine trees thick above us, when the fierce<lb/>
east wind is whistling in them, or as sound<lb/>
produced by breaking waves, when it is heard<lb/>
afar off, such the noise made by the crowd.<lb/>
But in that angry stirring of the throng<lb/>
one cry could be distinguished, “Which is he?”<lb/>
And they examined foreheads, and they sought<lb/>
predicted horns. Cippus then spoke again:<lb/>

    
“The man whom you demand,” he said, “is here!”<lb/>
And, fearless of the people, he threw back<lb/>
the chaplet from his forehead, so that all<lb/>
could see his temples plainly, wonderful<lb/>
for their two horns. All then turned down their eyes<lb/>
and uttered groans and (was it possible?)<lb/>
they looked unwillingly upon that head<lb/>
famed for its merit. They could not permit<lb/>
him to remain there long, deprived<lb/>
of honors, and they placed upon his head<lb/>
the festive chaplet. And the Senate gave<lb/>
you, Cippus, since you nevermore must come<lb/>
within the walls, a proof of their esteem—<lb/>
so much land as your oxen and their plow<lb/>
could circle round from dawn to setting sun.<lb/>
Moreover they engraved the shapely horns<lb/>
on the bronze pillars of the city gate, <lb/>
which for long ages kept his name revered.<lb/>


Aesculapius.
AESCULAPIUS BROUGHT TO ROME

Relate, O Muses, guardian deities<lb/>
of poets (for you know, and the remote<lb/>
antiquity conceals it not from you),<lb/>
the reason why an island, which the deep stream<lb/>
of Tiber closed about, has introduced<lb/>
Coronis' child among the deities<lb/>
guarding the city of famed Romulus.<lb/>

    
A dire contagion had infested long<lb/>
the Latin air, and men's pale bodies were<lb/>
deformed by a consumption that dried up<lb/>
the blood. When, frightened by so many deaths,<lb/>
they found all mortal efforts could avail<lb/>
them nothing, and physicians' skill had no<lb/>
effect, they sought the aid of heaven. They sent<lb/>
envoys to Delphi center of the world,<lb/>
and they entreated Phoebus to give aid<lb/>
in their distress, and by response renew<lb/>
their wasting lives and end a city's woe.<lb/>
While ground, and laurels and the quivers which<lb/>
the god hung there all shook, the tripod gave<lb/>
this answer from the deep recesses hid<lb/>
within the shrine, and stirred with trembling their<lb/>
astonished hearts—<lb/>

    
“What you are seeking here,<lb/>
O Romans, you should seek for nearer you.<lb/>
Then seek it nearer, for you do not need<lb/>
Apollo to relieve your wasting plague,<lb/>
you need Apollo's son. Go then to him<lb/>
with a good omen and invite his aid.”<lb/>

    
After the prudent Senate had received<lb/>
Phoebus Apollo's words, they took much pains<lb/>
to learn what town the son of Phoebus might<lb/>
inhabit. They despatched ambassadors<lb/>
under full sail to the coast of Epidaurus.<lb/>
When the curved ships had touched the shore, these men<lb/>
in haste went to the Grecian elders there<lb/>
and prayed that Rome might have the deity<lb/>
whose presence would drive out the mortal ill<lb/>
from their Ausonian nation; for they knew<lb/>
response unerring had directed them.<lb/>

    
The councillors dismayed, could not agree<lb/>
on their reply: some thought that aid ought not<lb/>
to be refused, but many more held back,<lb/>
declaring it was wise to keep the god<lb/>
for their own safety and not give away<lb/>
a guardian deity. And, while they talked,<lb/>
discussing it, the twilight had expelled <lb/>
the waning day, and darkness on the earth<lb/>
spread a thick mantle over the wide world.<lb/>

    
Then in your sleep, the healing deity<lb/>
appeared, O Roman leader, by your couch,<lb/>
as in his temple he is used to stand, <lb/>
holding in his left hand a rustic staff.<lb/>
Stroking his long beard with his right, he seemed<lb/>
to utter from his kindly breast these words:<lb/>

    
“Forget your fears; for I will come to you,<lb/>
and leave my altar. But now look well at <lb/>
the serpent with its binding folds entwined <lb/>
around this staff, and accurately mark<lb/>
it with your eyes that you may recognize it.<lb/>
I will transform myself into this shape<lb/>
but of a greater size, I will appear<lb/>
enlarged and of a magnitude to which<lb/>
a heavenly being ought to be transformed.”<lb/>

    
The god departed, when he said those words;<lb/>
and sleep went, when the god and words were gone;<lb/>
and genial light came, when the sleep had left.<lb/>
The morning then dispersed fire-given stars.<lb/>
The envoys met together in much doubt<lb/>
within the temple of the long sought god.<lb/>
They prayed the god to indicate for them,<lb/>
by clear celestial tokens, in what spot<lb/>
he wished to dwell.<lb/>

    
Scarce had they ceased the prayer<lb/>
for guidance, when the god all glittering<lb/>
with gold and as a serpent, crest erect,<lb/>
sent forth a hissing as to notify<lb/>
a quick approach— and in his coming shook<lb/>
his statue and the altars and the doors,<lb/>
the marble pavement and the gilded roof.<lb/>
Then up to his breast the serpent stood erect<lb/>
within the temple. He gazed on all with eyes<lb/>
that sparkled fire. The waiting multitude <lb/>
was frightened; but the priest, his chaste hair bound<lb/>
with a white fillet, knew the deity.<lb/>

    
“Behold the god!” he cried, “It is the god.<lb/>
Think holy thoughts and walk in reverent silence,<lb/>
all who are present. Oh, most Beautiful,<lb/>
let us behold you to our benefit, <lb/>
and give aid to this people that performs<lb/>
your sacred rites.”<lb/>


    
All present then adored<lb/>
the deity as bidden by the priest.<lb/>
The multitude repeated his good words,<lb/>
and the descendants of Aeneas gave<lb/>
good omen, with their feelings and their speech.<lb/>
Nodding well pleased and moving his great crest,<lb/>
the god at once assured them of his favor<lb/>
and hissed repeatedly with darting tongue.<lb/>
And then he glided down the polished steps;<lb/>
turned back his head; and, ready to depart,<lb/>
gazed on the altars he had known for so long—<lb/>
a last salute to the temple of his love.<lb/>

    
While all the people strewed his way with flowers, <lb/>
the great snake wound in sinuous course along<lb/>
and, passing through the middle of their town,<lb/>
came to the harbor and its curving wall.<lb/>
He stopped there, and it seemed that he dismissed<lb/>
his train and dutiful attendant crowd,<lb/>
and with a placid countenance he placed<lb/>
his mighty body in the Ausonian ship,<lb/>
which plainly showed the great weight of the god.<lb/>

    
The glad descendants of Aeneas all<lb/>
rejoiced, and they sacrificed a bull beside<lb/>
the harbor, wreathed the ship with flowers, and loosed<lb/>
the twisted hawsers from the shore. As a soft breeze<lb/>
impelled the ship, within her curving stern<lb/>
the god reclined, his coils uprising high,<lb/>
and gazed down on the blue Ionian waves.<lb/>
So wafted by the favoring winds, they came<lb/>
in six days to the shores of Italy.<lb/>

    
There he was borne past the Lacinian Cape,<lb/>
ennobled by the goddess Juno's shrine,<lb/>
and Scylacean coasts. He left behind<lb/>
Iapygia; then he shunned Amphrysian rocks<lb/>
upon the left and on the other side<lb/>
escaped Cocinthian crags. He passed, near by,<lb/>
Romechium and Caulon and Naricia;<lb/>
crossed the Sicilian sea; went through the strait;<lb/>
sailed by Pelorus and the island home <lb/>
of Aeolus and by the copper mines<lb/>
of Temesa. He turned then toward Leucosia <lb/>
and toward mild Paestum, famous for the rose.<lb/>
He coasted by Capreae and around<lb/>
Minerva's promontory and the hills<lb/>
ennobled with Surrentine vines, from there<lb/>
to Herculaneum and Stabiae<lb/>
and then Parthenope built for soft ease.<lb/>
He sailed near the Cumaean Sibyl's temple.<lb/>
He passed the Warm Springs and Linternum, where<lb/>
the mastick trees grow, and the river called<lb/>
Volturnus, where thick sand whirls in the stream,<lb/>
over to  Sinuessa's snow-white doves;<lb/>
and then to Antium and its rocky coast.<lb/>

    
When with all sails full spread the ship came in<lb/>
the harbor there (for now the seas grew rough),<lb/>
the god uncoiled his folds, and, gliding out <lb/>
with sinuous curves and all his mighty length,<lb/>
entered the temple of his parent, where<lb/>
it skirts that yellow shore. But, when the sea<lb/>
was calm again, the Epidaurian god<lb/>
departing from his father's shrine, where he<lb/>
a while had shared the sacred residence<lb/>
reared to a kindred deity, furrowed<lb/>
the sandy shore with weight of crackling scales,<lb/>
again he climbed into the lofty stern<lb/>
and near the rudder laid his head at rest.<lb/>

    
There he remained until the vessel passed<lb/>
by Castrum and Lavinium's sacred homes <lb/>
to where the Tiber flows into the sea<lb/>
there all the people of Rome came rushing out—<lb/>
mothers and fathers and even those who tend<lb/>
your sacred fire, O Trojan goddess Vesta—<lb/>
and joyous shouted welcome to the god.<lb/>
Wherever the swift ship steered through the tide,<lb/>
they built up many altars in a line,<lb/>
so that perfuming frankincense with smoke<lb/>
crackled along the banks on either hand,<lb/>
and victims made the keen knives hot with blood.<lb/>

    
The serpent-deity has entered Rome,<lb/>
the world's new capital and, lifting up<lb/>
his head above the summit of the mast,<lb/>
looked far and near for a congenial home.<lb/>
The river there, dividing, flows about<lb/>
a place known as the Island, on both sides<lb/>
an equal stream glides past dry middle ground.<lb/>
And here the serpent child of Phoebus left<lb/>
the Roman ship, took his own heavenly form,<lb/>
and brought the mourning city health once more<lb/>


Divus Iulius.
JULIUS CAESAR, TRANSFORMED TO A STAR

Apollo's son came to us from abroad,<lb/>
but Caesar is a god in his own land.<lb/>
The first in war and peace, he rose by wars,<lb/>
which closed in triumphs, and by civic deeds<lb/>
to glory quickly won, and even more<lb/>
his offspring's love exalted him as a new,<lb/>
a heavenly, sign and brightly flaming star.<lb/>
Of all the achievements of great Julius Caesar<lb/>
not one is more ennobling to his fame<lb/>
than being father of his glorious son.<lb/>

    
Was it more glorious for him to subdue<lb/>
the Britons guarded by their sheltering sea<lb/>
or lead his fleet victorious up the stream<lb/>
seven mouthed of the papyrus hearing Nile;<lb/>
to bring beneath the Roman people s rule<lb/>
rebel Numidia, Libyan Juba, and<lb/>
strong Pontus, proud of Mithridates' fame;<lb/>
to have some triumphs and deserve far more;<lb/>
than to be father of so great a man,<lb/>
with whom as ruler of the human race,<lb/>
O gods, you bless us past all reckoning?<lb/>

    
And, lest that son should come from mortal seed,<lb/>
Julius Caesar must change and be a god.<lb/>
When the golden mother of Aeneas was<lb/>
aware of this and saw a grievous end<lb/>
plotted against her high priest, saw the armed<lb/>
conspiracy preparing for his death,<lb/>
with pallid face she met each god and said:<lb/>

    
“Look with what might this plot prepares itself<lb/>
against my cause; with how much guile it dooms<lb/>
the head which is the last that I have left<lb/>
from old-time Iulus, prince and heir of Troy.<lb/>
Shall I alone be harassed through all time<lb/>
by fear well grounded? First the son of Tydeus<lb/>
must wound me with his Calydonian spear;<lb/>
and then I tremble at the tottering walls<lb/>
of ill defended Troy; I watch my son<lb/>
driven in long wanderings, tossed upon the sea,<lb/>
descending to the realm of silent shades, <lb/>
and waging war with Turnus—or, if I should speak<lb/>
the truth, with Juno! Why do I recall<lb/>
disasters of my race from long ago?<lb/>
The present dread forbids my looking back<lb/>
at ills now past. See how the wicked swords<lb/>
are whetted for the crime! Forbid it now,<lb/>
I pray you, and prevent the deed,<lb/>
let not the priest's warm blood quench vestal fires!”<lb/>

    
Such words as these, full of her anxious thoughts,<lb/>
Venus proclaimed through all the heavens, in vain.<lb/>
The gods were moved, and, since they could not break<lb/>
the ancient sisters' iron decree, they gave<lb/>
instead clear portents of approaching woe.<lb/>

    
It is declared, resounding arms heard from<lb/>
the black clouds and unearthly trumpet blasts<lb/>
and clarions heard through all the highest heavens,<lb/>
forewarned men of the crime. The sad sun's face<lb/>
gave to the frightened world a livid light;<lb/>
and in the night-time torches seemed to burn<lb/>
amid the stars, and often drops of blood<lb/>
fell in rain-showers. Then Lucifer shone blue<lb/>
with all his visage stained by darksome rust.<lb/>
The chariot of the moon was sprinkled with<lb/>
red blood. The Stygian owl gave to the world<lb/>
ill omens. In a thousand places, tears<lb/>
were shed by the ivory statues. Dirges, too,<lb/>
are said to have been heard, and threatening words<lb/>
by unknown speakers in the sacred groves.<lb/>

    
No victim gave an omen of good life:<lb/>
the fibers showed great tumults imminent,<lb/>
the liver's cut-off edge was found among<lb/>
the entrails. In the Forum, it is said,<lb/>
and round men's homes and temples of the gods<lb/>
dogs howled all through the night, and silent shades<lb/>
wandered abroad, and earthquakes shook the city.<lb/>

    
But portents of the gods could not avert<lb/>
the plots of men and stay approaching fate.<lb/>
Into a temple naked swords were brought—<lb/>
into the Senate House. No other place<lb/>
in all our city was considered fit<lb/>
for perpetrating such a dreadful crime!<lb/>
With both hands Cytherea beat her breast,<lb/>
and in a cloud she strove to hide the last<lb/>
of great Aeneas' line, as in times past<lb/>
she had hid Paris from fierce Menelaus<lb/>
Aeneas from the blade of Diomed.<lb/>

    
But Jove, her father, cautioned her and said,<lb/>
“Do you my daughter, without aid, alone,<lb/>
attempt to change the fixed decrees of Fate?<lb/>
Unaided you may enter the abode<lb/>
of the three sisters and can witness there<lb/>
a register of deeds the future brings.<lb/>
These, wrought of brass and solid iron with<lb/>
vast labor, are unchangeable through all<lb/>
eternity; and have no weakening fears<lb/>
of thunder-shocks from heaven, nor from the rage<lb/>
of lightnings they are perfectly secure<lb/>
from all destruction. You will surely find<lb/>
the destinies of your descendants there,<lb/>
engraved in everlasting adamant.<lb/>
'Tis certain. I myself, have read them there:<lb/>
and I, with care have marked them in my mind.<lb/>
I will repeat them so that you may have<lb/>
unerring knowledge of those future days.<lb/>

    
“Venus, the man on whose behalf you are<lb/>
so anxious, already has completed his<lb/>
alloted time. The years are ended which<lb/>
he owed to life on earth. You with his son,<lb/>
who now as heir to his estate must bear<lb/>
the burden of that government, will cause<lb/>
him, as a deity, to reach the heavens,<lb/>
and to be worshipped in the temples here.<lb/>

    
“The valiant son will plan revenge on those<lb/>
who killed his father and will have our aid<lb/>
in all his battles. The defeated walls<lb/>
of scarred Mutina, which he will besiege,<lb/>
shall sue for peace. Pharsalia's plain will dread<lb/>
his power and Macedonian Philippi<lb/>
be drenched with blood a second time, the name<lb/>
of one acclaimed as ‘Great’ shall be subdued<lb/>
in the Sicilian waves. Then Egypt's queen,<lb/>
wife of the Roman general, Antony,<lb/>
shall fall, while vainly trusting in his word,<lb/>
while vainly threatening that our Capitol<lb/>
must be submissive to Canopus' power.<lb/>
“Why should I mention all the barbarous lands<lb/>
and nations east and west by ocean's rim?<lb/>
Whatever habitable earth contains<lb/>
shall bow to him, the sea shall serve his will!<lb/>

    
“With peace established over all the lands,<lb/>
he then will turn his mind to civil rule<lb/>
and as a prudent legislator will<lb/>
enact wise laws. And he will regulate<lb/>
the manners of his people by his own<lb/>
example. Looking forward to the days<lb/>
of future time and of posterity,<lb/>
he will command the offspring born of his<lb/>
devoted wife, to assume the imperial name<lb/>
and the burden of his cares. Nor till his age<lb/>
shall equal Nestor's years will he ascend<lb/>
to heavenly dwellings and his kindred stars.<lb/>
Meanwhile transform the soul, which shall be reft<lb/>
from this doomed body, to a starry light,<lb/>
that always god-like Julius may look down<lb/>
in future from his heavenly residence<lb/>
upon our Forum and our Capitol.”<lb/>

    
Jupiter hardly had pronounced these words,<lb/>
when kindly Venus, although seen by none,<lb/>
stood in the middle of the Senate-house,<lb/>
and caught from the dying limbs and trunk<lb/>
of her own Caesar his departing soul.<lb/>
She did not give it time so that it could<lb/>
dissolve in air, but bore it quickly up,<lb/>
toward all the stars of heaven; and on the way,<lb/>
she saw it gleam and blaze and set it free.<lb/>
Above the moon it mounted into heaven,<lb/>
leaving behind a long and fiery trail,<lb/>
and as a star it glittered in the sky.<lb/>

    
There, wondering at the younger Caesar's deeds,<lb/>
Julius confessed they were superior<lb/>
to all of his, and he rejoiced because<lb/>
his son was greater even than himself.<lb/>
Although the son forbade men to regard<lb/>
his own deeds as the: mightier! Fame, that moves<lb/>
free and untrammelled by the laws of men,<lb/>
preferred him even against his own desire<lb/>
and in that one point disobeyed his will.<lb/>

    
And so great Atreus yields to greater fame<lb/>
of Agamemnon, Aegeus yields to Theseus,<lb/>
and Peleus to Achilles, or, to name<lb/>
a parallel befitting these two gods,<lb/>
so Saturn yields to Jove. Now Jupiter<lb/>
rules in high heavens and is the suzerain<lb/>
over the waters and the world of shades,<lb/>
and now Augustus rules in all the lands—<lb/>
so each is both a father and a god.<lb/>

    
Gods who once guarded our Aeneas, when<lb/>
both swords and fire gave way, and native gods<lb/>
of Italy, and Father Quirinus—<lb/>
patron of Rome, and you Gradivus too—<lb/>
the sire of Quirinus the invincible,<lb/>
and Vesta hallowed among Caesar's gods,<lb/>
and Phoebus ever worshipped at his hearth,<lb/>
and Jupiter who rules the citadel<lb/>
high on Tarpeia's cliff, and other gods—<lb/>
all gods to whom a poet rightfully<lb/>
and with all piety may make appeal;<lb/>
far be that day—postponed beyond our time,<lb/>
when great Augustus shall foresake the earth<lb/>
which he now governs, and mount up to heaven,<lb/>
from that far height to hear his people's prayers!<lb/>

    
And now, I have completed a great work,<lb/>
which not Jove's anger, and not fire nor steel,<lb/>
nor fast-consuming time can sweep away.<lb/>
Whenever it will, let the day come, which has<lb/>
dominion only over this mortal frame,<lb/>
and end for me the uncertain course of life.<lb/>
Yet in my better part I shall be borne<lb/>
immortal, far above the stars on high,<lb/>
and mine shall be a name indelible.<lb/>
Wherever Roman power extends her sway<lb/>
over the conquered lands, I shall be read<lb/>
by lips of men. If Poets' prophecies<lb/>
have any truth, through all the coming years<lb/>
of future ages, I shall live in fame.<lb/>

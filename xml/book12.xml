Graeci Aulide. Fama.
EVENTS IN AULIS

Sadly his father, Priam, mourned for him,<lb/>
not knowing that young Aesacus had assumed<lb/>
wings on his shoulders, and was yet alive.<lb/>
Then also Hector with his brothers made<lb/>
complete but unavailing sacrifice,<lb/>
upon a tomb which bore his carved name.<lb/>
Paris was absent. But soon afterwards,<lb/>
he brought into that land a ravished wife,<lb/>
Helen, the cause of a disastrous war,<lb/>
together with a thousand ships, and all<lb/>
the great Pelasgian nation.<lb/>

    
Vengeance would<lb/>
not long have been delayed, but the fierce winds<lb/>
raged over seas impassable, and held<lb/>
the ships at fishy Aulis. They could not<lb/>
be moved from the Boeotian land. Here, when<lb/>
a sacrifice had been prepared to Jove,<lb/>
according to the custom of their land,<lb/>
and when the ancient altar glowed with fire,<lb/>
the Greeks observed an azure colored snake<lb/>
crawling up in a plane tree near the place<lb/>
where they had just begun their sacrifice.<lb/>
Among the highest branches was a nest,<lb/>
with twice four birds—and those the serpent seized<lb/>
together with the mother-bird as she<lb/>
was fluttering round her loss. And every bird<lb/>
the serpent buried in his greedy maw.<lb/>
All stood amazed: but Calchas, who perceived<lb/>
the truth, exclaimed, “Rejoice Pelasgian men,<lb/>
for we shall conquer; Troy will fall; although<lb/>
the toil of war must long continue—so<lb/>
the nine birds equal nine long years of war.”<lb/>
And while he prophesied, the serpent, coiled<lb/>
about the tree, was transformed to a stone,<lb/>
curled crooked as a snake. <lb/>

    
but Nereus stormed<lb/>
in those Aonian waves, and not a ship<lb/>
moved forward. Some declared that Neptune thus<lb/>
was aiding Troy, because he built the walls<lb/>
of that great city. Not so Calchas, son<lb/>
of Thestor! He knew all the truth, and told<lb/>
them plainly that a virgin's blood<lb/>
alone might end a virgin goddess' wrath.<lb/>

    
The public good at last prevailed above<lb/>
affection, and the duty of a king<lb/>
at last proved stronger than a father's love:<lb/>
when Iphigenia as a sacrifice,<lb/>
stood by the altar with her weeping maids<lb/>
and was about to offer her chaste blood,<lb/>
the goddess, moved by pity, spread a mist<lb/>
before their eyes, amid the sacred rites<lb/>
and mournful supplications. It is said<lb/>
she left a hind there in the maiden's place<lb/>
and carried Iphigenia away. The hind,<lb/>
as it was fitting, calmed Diana's rage<lb/>
and also calmed the anger of the sea.<lb/>
The thousand ships received the winds astern<lb/>
and gained the Phrygian shore.<lb/>

THE HOUSE OF FAME AND THE TROJAN CYGNUS

There is a spot<lb/>
convenient in the center of the world,<lb/>
between the land and sea and the wide heavens,<lb/>
the meeting of the threefold universe.<lb/>
From there is seen all things that anywhere<lb/>
exist, although in distant regions far;<lb/>
and there all sounds of earth and space are heard.<lb/>

    
Fame is possessor of this chosen place,<lb/>
and has her habitation in a tower,<lb/>
which aids her view from that exalted highs.<lb/>
And she has fixed there numerous avenues,<lb/>
and openings, a thousand, to her tower<lb/>
and no gates with closed entrance, for the house<lb/>
is open, night and day, of sounding brass,<lb/>
reechoing the tones of every voice.<lb/>
It must repeat whatever it may hear;<lb/>
and there's no rest, and silence in no part.<lb/>
There is no clamor; but the murmuring sound<lb/>
of subdued voices, such as may arise<lb/>
from waves of a far sea, which one may hear<lb/>
who listens at a distance; or the sound<lb/>
which ends a thunderclap, when Jupiter<lb/>
has clashed black clouds together. Fickle crowds<lb/>
are always in that hall, that come and go,<lb/>
and myriad rumors—false tales mixed with true—<lb/>
are circulated in confusing words.<lb/>
Some fill their empty ears with all this talk,<lb/>
and some spread elsewhere all that's told to them.<lb/>
The volume of wild fiction grows apace,<lb/>
and each narrator adds to what he hears.<lb/>

    
Credulity is there and rash Mistake,<lb/>
and empty Joy, and coward Fear alarmed<lb/>
by quick Sedition, and soft Whisper—all<lb/>
of doubtful life. Fame sees what things are done<lb/>
in heaven and on the sea, and on the earth.<lb/>
She spies all things in the wide universe.<lb/>


Achilles et Cygnus.

Fame now had spread the tidings, a great fleet<lb/>
of Greek ships was at that time on its way,<lb/>
an army of brave men. The Trojans stood,<lb/>
all ready to prevent the hostile Greeks<lb/>
from landing on their shores. By the decree<lb/>
of Fate, the first man killed of the invaders' force<lb/>
was strong Protesilaus, by the spear<lb/>
of valiant Hector, whose unthought-of power<lb/>
at that time was discovered by the Greeks<lb/>
to their great cost. The Phyrgians also learned,<lb/>
at no small cost of blood, what warlike strength<lb/>
came from the Grecian land. The Sigean shores<lb/>
grew red with death-blood: Cygnus, Neptune's son,<lb/>
there slew a thousand men: for which, in wrath,<lb/>
Achilles pressed his rapid chariot<lb/>
straight through the Trojan army; making a lane<lb/>
with his great spear, shaped from a Pelion tree.<lb/>
And as he sought through the fierce battle's press,<lb/>
either for Cygnus or for Hector, he<lb/>
met Cygnus and engaged at once with him<lb/>
(Fate had preserved great Hector from such foe<lb/>
till ten years from that day).<lb/>

    
Cheering his steeds,<lb/>
their white necks pressed upon the straining yoke,<lb/>
he steered the chariot towards his foe,<lb/>
and, brandishing the spear with his strong arm,<lb/>
he cried, “Whoever you may be, you have<lb/>
the consolation of a glorious death<lb/>
you die by me, Haemonian Achilles!”<lb/>

    
His heavy spear flew after the fierce words.<lb/>
Although the spear was whirled direct and true,<lb/>
yet nothing it availed with sharpened point.<lb/>
It only bruised, as with a blunted stroke,<lb/>
the breast of Cygnus! “By report we knew<lb/>
of you before this battle, goddess born.”<lb/>
The other answered him, “But why are you<lb/>
surprised that I escape the threatened wound?”<lb/>
(Achilles was surprised). “This helmet crowned,<lb/>
great with its tawny horse-hair, and this shield,<lb/>
broad-hollowed, on my left arm, are not held<lb/>
for help in war: they are but ornament,<lb/>
as Mars wears armor. All of them shall be<lb/>
put off, and I will fight with you unhurt.<lb/>
It is a privilege that I was born<lb/>
not as you, of a Nereid but of him<lb/>
whose powerful rule is over Nereus,<lb/>
his daughters and their ocean.” So, he spoke.<lb/>

    
Immediately he threw his spear against Achilles,<lb/>
destined to pierce the curving shield through brass,<lb/>
and through nine folds of tough bull's hide.<lb/>
It stopped there, for it could not pierce the tenth.<lb/>
The hero wrenched it out, and hurled again<lb/>
a quivering spear at Cygnus, with great strength.<lb/>
The Trojan stood unwounded and unharmed.<lb/>
Nor did a third spear injure Cygnus, though<lb/>
he stood there with his body all exposed.<lb/>
Achilles raged at this, as a wild bull<lb/>
in open circus, when with dreadful horns<lb/>
he butts against the hanging purple robes<lb/>
which stir his wrath and there observes how they<lb/>
evade him, quite unharmed by his attack.<lb/>

    
Achilles then examined his good spear,<lb/>
to see if by some chance the iron point<lb/>
was broken from it, but the point was firm,<lb/>
fixed on the wooden shaft. “My hand is weak,”<lb/>
he said, “but is it possible its strength<lb/>
forsook me though it never has before?<lb/>
For surely I had my accustomed strength,<lb/>
when first I overthrew Lyrnessus' walls,<lb/>
or when I won the isle of Tenedos<lb/>
or Thebes (then under King Eetion)<lb/>
and I drenched both with their own peoples' blood,<lb/>
or when the river Caycus ran red<lb/>
with slaughter of its people, or, when twice<lb/>
Telephus felt the virtue of my spear.<lb/>
On this field also, where such heaps lie slain,<lb/>
my right hand surely has proved its true might;<lb/>
and it is mighty.”<lb/>

    
So he spoke of strength,<lb/>
remembered. But as if in proof against<lb/>
his own distrust, he hurled a spear against<lb/>
Menoetes, a soldier in the Lycian ranks.<lb/>
The sharp spear tore the victim's coat of mail<lb/>
and pierced his breast beneath. Achilles, when<lb/>
he saw his dying head strike on the earth<lb/>
wrenched the same spear from out the reeking wound,<lb/>
and said, “This is the hand, and this the spear<lb/>
I conquered with; and I will use the same<lb/>
against him who in luck escaped their power;<lb/>
and the result should favor as I pray<lb/>
the helpful gods.”<lb/>

    
And, as he said such words,<lb/>
in haste he hurled his ashen spear, again<lb/>
at Cygnus. It went straight and struck unshunned.<lb/>
Resounding on the shoulder of that foe,<lb/>
it bounced back as if it hit a wall<lb/>
or solid cliff. Yet when Achilles saw<lb/>
just where the spear struck, Cygnus there<lb/>
was stained with blood. He instantly rejoiced;<lb/>
but vainly, for it was Menoetes' blood!<lb/>
Then in a sudden rage, Achilles leaped<lb/>
down headlong from his lofty chariot;<lb/>
and, seeking his god-favored foe, he struck<lb/>
in conflict fiercely, with his gleaming sword.<lb/>
Although he saw that he had pierced both shield<lb/>
and helmet through, he did not harm the foe—<lb/>
his sword was even blunted on the flesh.<lb/>

    
Achilles could not hold himself for rage,<lb/>
but furious, with his sword-hilt and his shield<lb/>
he battered wildly the uncovered face<lb/>
and hollow-temples of his Trojan foe.<lb/>
Cygnus gave way; Achilles rushed on him,<lb/>
buffeting fiercely, so that he could not<lb/>
recover from the shock. Fear seized upon<lb/>
Cygnus, and darkness swam before his eyes.<lb/>
Then, as he moved back with retreating steps,<lb/>
a large stone hindered him and blocked his way.<lb/>
His back pushed against this, Achilles seized<lb/>
and dashed him violently to the ground.<lb/>
Then pressing with buckler and hard knees the breast<lb/>
of Cygnus, he unlaced the helmet thongs,<lb/>
wound them about the foeman's neck and drew<lb/>
them tightly under his chin, till Cygnus' throat<lb/>
could take no breath of life. Achilles rose<lb/>
eager to strip his conquered foe but found<lb/>
his empty armor, for the god of ocean<lb/>
had changed the victim into that white bird<lb/>
whose name he lately bore.<lb/>


Caeneus.
CAENEUS TRANSFORMED INTO A BIRD

There was a truce<lb/>
for many days after this opening fight<lb/>
while both sides resting, laid aside their arms.<lb/>
A watchful guard patroled the Phrygian walls;<lb/>
the Grecian trenches had their watchful guard.<lb/>
Then, on a festal day, Achilles gave<lb/>
the blood of a slain heifer to obtain<lb/>
the favor of Athena for their cause.<lb/>
The entrails burned upon the altar, while<lb/>
the odor, grateful to the deities,<lb/>
was mounting to the skies. When sacred rites<lb/>
were done, a banquet for the heroes was<lb/>
served on their tables. There the Grecian chiefs<lb/>
reclined on couches; while they satisfied<lb/>
themselves with roasted flesh, and banished cares:<lb/>
and thirst with wine. Nor harp nor singing voice<lb/>
nor long pipe made of boxwood pierced with holes,<lb/>
delighted them. They talked of their own deeds<lb/>
and valor, all that thrilling night: and even<lb/>
the strength of enemies whom they had met<lb/>
and overcome. What else could they admit<lb/>
or think of, while the great Achilles spoke<lb/>
or listened to them? But especially<lb/>
the recent victory over Cygnus held<lb/>
them ardent. Wonderful it seemed to them<lb/>
that such a youth could be composed of flesh<lb/>
not penetrable by the sharpest spear;<lb/>
of flesh which blunted even hardened steel,<lb/>
and never could be wounded. All the Greeks,<lb/>
and even Achilles wondered at the thought.<lb/>

    
Then Nestor said to them: “During your time,<lb/>
Cygnus has been the only man you knew<lb/>
who could despise all weapons and whose flesh<lb/>
could not be pierced by thrust of sword or spear.<lb/>
But long ago I saw another man<lb/>
able to bear unharmed a thousand strokes,<lb/>
Caeneus of Thessaly, Caeneus who lived<lb/>
upon Mt. Othrys. He was famed in war<lb/>
yet, strange to say, by birth he was a woman!”<lb/>

    
Then all expressed the greatest wonderment,<lb/>
and begged to hear the story of his life.<lb/>
Achilles cried, “O eloquent old man!<lb/>
The wisdom of our age! All of us wish<lb/>
to hear, who was this Caeneus? Why was he<lb/>
changed to the other sex? in what campaigns,<lb/>
and in what wars was he so known to you?<lb/>
Who conquered him, if any ever did?”<lb/>

    
The aged man replied to them with care:—<lb/>
“Although my great age is a harm to me,<lb/>
and many actions of my early days<lb/>
escape my memory; yet, most of them<lb/>
are well remembered. Nothing of old days,<lb/>
amid so many deeds of war and peace,<lb/>
can be more firmly fixed upon my mind<lb/>
than the strange story I shall tell of him.<lb/>

    
“If long extent of years made anyone<lb/>
a witness of most wonderful events<lb/>
and many, truly I may say to you<lb/>
that I have lived two hundred years; and now<lb/>
have entered my third century.<lb/>
The daughter of Elatus, Caenis, was<lb/>
remarkable for charm—most beautiful<lb/>
of all Thessalian maidens—many sighed<lb/>
for her in vain through all the neighboring towns<lb/>
and yours, Achilles, for that was her home.<lb/>
But Peleus did not try to win her love,<lb/>
for he was either married at that time<lb/>
to your dear mother, or was pledged to her.<lb/>

    
“Caenis never became the willing bride<lb/>
of any suitor; but report declares,<lb/>
while she was walking on a lonely shore,<lb/>
the god of ocean saw and ravished her.<lb/>
And in the joy of that love Neptune said,<lb/>
‘Request of me whatever you desire,  <lb/>
and nothing shall deny your dearest wish!’—<lb/>
the story tells us that he made this pledge.<lb/>
And Caenis said to Neptune, ‘The great wrong,<lb/>
which I have suffered from you justifies<lb/>
the wonderful request that I must make;<lb/>
I ask that I may never suffer such<lb/>
an injury again. Grant I may be<lb/>
no longer woman, and I'll ask no more.’<lb/>

    
while she was speaking to him, the last words<lb/>
of her strange prayer were uttered in so deep,<lb/>
in such a manly tone, it seemed indeed<lb/>
they must be from a man.—That was a fact:<lb/>
Neptune not only had allowed her prayer  <lb/>
but made the new man proof against all wounds<lb/>
of spear or sword. Rejoicing in the gift<lb/>
he went his way as Caeneus Atracides,<lb/>
spent years in every manful exercise,<lb/>
and roamed the plains of northern Thessaly.<lb/>


Centaurorum et Lapitharum pugna.

“The son of bold Ixion, Pirithous<lb/>
wedding Hippodame, had asked as guests<lb/>
the cloud-born centaurs to recline around<lb/>
the ordered tables, in a cool cave, set<lb/>
under some shading trees. Thessalian chiefs<lb/>
were there and I myself was with them there.<lb/>
The festal place resounded with the rout<lb/>
in noisy clamor, singing nuptial verse;<lb/>
and in the great room, filled with smoking fire,<lb/>
the maiden came escorted by a crowd<lb/>
of matrons and young married women; she<lb/>
most beautiful of all that lovely throng.<lb/>

    
“And so Pirithous, the fortunate son,<lb/>
of bold Ixion, was so praised by all,<lb/>
for his pure joy and lovely wife,<lb/>
it seemed his very blessings must have led<lb/>
to fatal harm: for savage Eurytus,<lb/>
wildest of the wild centaurs, now inflamed<lb/>
with sudden envy, drunkenness, and lust,<lb/>
upset the tables and made havoc there<lb/>
so dreadful, that the banquet suddenly<lb/>
was changed from love to uproar. Seized by the hair,<lb/>
the bride was violently dragged away.<lb/>
When Eurytus caught up Hippodame<lb/>
each one of all the centaurs took at will<lb/>
the maid or matron that he longed for most.<lb/>
The palace, seeming like a captured town,<lb/>
resounded with affrighted shrieks of women.<lb/>
At once we all sprang up. And Theseus cried,<lb/>

    
“What madness, Eurytus, has driven you<lb/>
to this vile wickedness! While I have life,<lb/>
you dare attack Pirithous. You know<lb/>
not what you do, for one wrong injures both!’<lb/>
The valiant hero did not merely talk:<lb/>
he pushed them off as they were pressing on,<lb/>
and rescued her whom Eurytus had seized.<lb/>
Since Eurytus could not defend such deeds<lb/>
with words, he turned and beat with violent hands<lb/>
the face of him who saved the bride and struck<lb/>
his generous breast. By chance, an ancient bowl<lb/>
was near at hand. This rough with figures carved,<lb/>
the son of Aegeus caught and hurled it full<lb/>
in that vile centaur's face. He, spouting out<lb/>
thick gouts of blood, and bleeding from his wounds—<lb/>
his brains and wine mixed,—kicked the blood-soaked sand.<lb/>

    
His double membered centaur brothers, wild<lb/>
with passion at his death, all shouted out,<lb/>
‘To arms! to arms!’ Their courage raised by wine!<lb/>
In their first onset, hurled cups flew about,<lb/>
and shattered wine casks, hollow basins—things<lb/>
before adapted to a banquet, now<lb/>
for death and carnage in the furious fight.<lb/>

    
Amycus first (Opinion's son) began to spoil<lb/>
the inner sanctuary of its gifts.<lb/>
He snatched up from that shrine a chandelier,<lb/>
adorned with glittering lamps, and lifted high,<lb/>
with all the force of one who strives to break<lb/>
the bull s white neck with sacrificial axe,<lb/>
he dashed it at the head of Celadon,<lb/>
one of the Lapithae, and crushed his skull<lb/>
into the features of his face. His eyes<lb/>
leaped from his sockets, and the shattered bones<lb/>
of his smashed face gave way so that his nose<lb/>
was driven back and fastened in his throat.<lb/>
But Belates of Pella tore away<lb/>
a table-leg of maple wood and felled<lb/>
Amycus to the ground; his sunken chin<lb/>
cast down upon his breast; and, as he spat<lb/>
his teeth out mixed with blood, a second blow<lb/>
despatched him to the shades of Tartarus.<lb/>

    
“Gryneus, seeing a smoking altar, cried,<lb/>
‘Good use for this,’ with which words he raised up<lb/>
that heavy, blazing altar. Hurling it<lb/>
into the middle of the Lapithae,<lb/>
he struck down Broteas and Orius:<lb/>
Mycale, mother of that Orius,<lb/>
was famous for her incantations,<lb/>
which she had often used to conjure down<lb/>
the shining twin-horns of the unwilling moon.<lb/>
Exadius threatened, ‘You shall not escape!<lb/>
Let me but have a weapon!’ And with that,<lb/>
he whirled the antlers of a votive stag,<lb/>
which he found there, hung on a tall pine-tree;<lb/>
and with that double-branching horn he pierced<lb/>
the eyes of Gryneus, and he gouged them out.<lb/>
One eye stuck to the horn; the other rolled<lb/>
down on his beard, to which it strictly clung<lb/>
in dreadful clotted gore.<lb/>

    
Then Rhoetus snatched<lb/>
a blazing brand of plum-wood from an altar<lb/>
and whirling it upon the right, smashed through<lb/>
the temples of Charaxus, wonderful<lb/>
with golden hair. Seized by the violent flames,<lb/>
his yellow locks burned fiercely, as a field<lb/>
of autumn grain; and even the scorching blood<lb/>
gave from the sore wound a terrific noise<lb/>
as a red-hot iron in pincers which the smith<lb/>
lifts out and plunges in the tepid pool,<lb/>
hissing and sizzling. Charaxus shook<lb/>
the fire from his burnt locks; and heaved up on<lb/>
his shoulders a large threshold stone torn from<lb/>
the ground—a weight sufficient for a team<lb/>
of oxen. The vast weight impeded him,<lb/>
so that it could not even touch his foe—<lb/>
and yet, the massive stone did hit his friend,<lb/>
Cometes, who was standing near to him,<lb/>
and crushed him down. Then Rhoetus, crazed with joy,<lb/>
exulting yelled, ‘I pray that all of you<lb/>
may be so strong!’ Wielding his half-burnt stake<lb/>
with heavy blows again and again, he broke<lb/>
the sutures of his enemy's skull, until<lb/>
the bones were mingled with his oozing brains.<lb/>

    
“Victorious, then rushed he upon Evagrus,<lb/>
and Corythus and Dryas. First of these<lb/>
was youthful Corythus, whose cheeks were then<lb/>
just covered with soft down. When he fell dead,<lb/>
Evagrus cried, ‘What glory do you get,<lb/>
killing a boy?’ But Rhoetus did not give<lb/>
him time for uttering one word more. He pushed<lb/>
the red hot stake into the foeman's mouth,<lb/>
while he still spoke, and down into his lungs.<lb/>
He then pursued the savage Dryas, while<lb/>
whirling the red fire fast about his head;<lb/>
but not with like success, for, while he still<lb/>
rejoiced in killings, Dryas turned and pierced<lb/>
him with a stake where neck and shoulder meet.<lb/>

    
“Rhoetus groaned and with a great effort pulled<lb/>
the stake out from the bone, then fled away,<lb/>
drenched in his blood. And Orneus followed him.<lb/>
Lycabas fled, and Medon with a wound<lb/>
in his right shoulder. Thaumas and Pisenor<lb/>
and Mermerus fled with them. Mermerus,<lb/>
who used to excell all others in a race,<lb/>
ran slowly, crippled by a recent wound.<lb/>
Pholus and Melaneus ran for their lives<lb/>
and with them Abas, hunter of wild boars<lb/>
and Asbolus, the augur, who in vain<lb/>
had urged his friends to shun that hapless fight.<lb/>
As Nessus joined the rout, he said to him,<lb/>
‘You need not flee, for you shall be reserved<lb/>
a victim for the bow of Hercules!’<lb/>

    
but neither Lycidas, Eurynomus<lb/>
nor Areos, nor Imbreus had escaped<lb/>
from death: for all of these the strong right hand<lb/>
of Dryas pierced, as they confronted him.<lb/>
Crenaeus there received a wound in front.<lb/>
Although he turned in flight, as he looked back,<lb/>
a heavy javelin between his eyes<lb/>
pierced through him, where his nose and forehead joined.<lb/>


    
“In all this uproar, Aphidas lay flat,<lb/>
in endless slumber from the wine he drank,<lb/>
incessant, and his nerveless hand still held<lb/>
the cup of mixed wine, as he lay full stretched,<lb/>
upon a shaggy bear-skin from Mount Ossa.<lb/>
When Phorbas saw him, harmless in that sleep,<lb/>
he laid his fingers in his javelin's thong,<lb/>
and shouted loudly, ‘Mix your wine, down there,<lb/>
with waters of the Styx!’ And stopping talk,<lb/>
let fly his javelin at the sleeping youth—<lb/>
the ashen shaft, iron-tipped, was driven through<lb/>
his neck, exposed, as he by chance lay there—<lb/>
his head thrown back. He did not even feel<lb/>
a touch of death—and from his deep-pierced throat<lb/>
his crimson blood flowed out upon the couch,<lb/>
and in the wine-bowl still grasped in his hand.<lb/>

    
“I saw Petraeus when he strove to tear<lb/>
up from the earth, an acorn-bearing oak.<lb/>
And, while he struggled with it, back and forth,<lb/>
and was just ready to wrench up the trunk,<lb/>
Pirithous hurled a well aimed spear at him,<lb/>
transfixed his ribs, and pinned his body tight,<lb/>
writhing, to that hard oak: and Lycus fell<lb/>
and Chromis fell, before Pirithous.<lb/>

    
“They gave less glory to the conqueror<lb/>
than Helops or than Dictys. Helops was<lb/>
killed by a javelin, which pierced his temples<lb/>
from the right side, clear through to his left ear.<lb/>
And Dictys, running in a desperate haste,<lb/>
hoping in vain, to escape Ixion's son,<lb/>
slipped on the steep edge of a precipice;<lb/>
and, as he fell down headlong crashed into<lb/>
the top of a huge ash-tree, which impaled<lb/>
his dying body on its broken spikes.<lb/>

    
“Aphareus, eager to avenge him tried<lb/>
to lift a rock from that steep mountain side;<lb/>
but as he heaved, the son of Aegeus struck<lb/>
him squarely with an oaken club; and smashed,<lb/>
and broke the huge bones of that centaur's arm.<lb/>
He has no time, and does not want to give<lb/>
that useless foe to death. He leaps upon<lb/>
the back of tall Bienor, never trained<lb/>
to carry riders, and he fixed his knees<lb/>
firm in the centaur's ribs, and holding tight<lb/>
to the long hair, seized by his left hand, struck<lb/>
and shattered the hard features and fierce face<lb/>
and bony temples with his club of gnarled<lb/>
strong oak. And with it, he struck to the ground<lb/>
Nedymnus and Lycopes, dart expert,<lb/>
and Hippasus, whose beard hid all his breast.<lb/>
And Rhipheus taller than the highest trees<lb/>
and Thereus, who would carry home alive<lb/>
the raging bears, caught in Thessalian hills.<lb/>

    
Demoleon could no longer stand and look<lb/>
on Theseus and his unrestrained success.<lb/>
He struggled with vast effort to tear up<lb/>
an old pine, trunk and all, with its long roots,<lb/>
and, failing shortly in that first attempt,<lb/>
he broke it off and hurled it at his foe.<lb/>
But Theseus saw the pine tree in its flight<lb/>
and, warned by Pallas, got beyond its range—<lb/>
his boast was, Pallas had directed him!<lb/>
And yet, the missle was not launched in vain.<lb/>
It sheared the left shoulder and the breast<lb/>
from tall Crantor. He, Achilles, was<lb/>
your father's armor bearer and was given<lb/>
by King Amyntor, when he sued for peace.<lb/>

    
“When Peleus at a distance saw him torn<lb/>
and mangled, he exclaimed, ‘At least receive<lb/>
this sacrifice, O Crantor! most beloved!<lb/>
Dearest of young men!’ And with sturdy arm<lb/>
and all his strength of soul as well, he hurled<lb/>
his ashen lance against Demoleon,<lb/>
which piercing through his shivered ribs, hung there<lb/>
and quivered in the bones. The centaur wrenched<lb/>
the wooden shaft out, with his frenzied hands,<lb/>
but could not move the pointed head, which stuck<lb/>
within his lungs. His very anguish gave<lb/>
him such a desperation, that he rose<lb/>
against his foe and trampled and beat down<lb/>
the hero with his hoofs, Peleus allowed<lb/>
the blows to fall on helm and ringing shield.<lb/>
Protected so, he watched his time and thrust<lb/>
up through the centaur's shoulder. By one stroke<lb/>
he pierced two breasts, where horse and man-form met.<lb/>

    
Before this, Peleus with the spear had killed<lb/>
both Myles and Phlegraeus and with the sword<lb/>
Iphinous and Clanis. Now he killed<lb/>
Dorylas, who was clad in a wolfskin cap<lb/>
and fought with curving bull's horns dripping blood.<lb/>

    
“To him I said, for courage gave me strength,<lb/>
‘Your horns! how much inferior to my steel!’—<lb/>
and threw my spear. Since he could not avoid<lb/>
the gleaming point, he held up his right hand<lb/>
to shield his forehead from the threatened wound.<lb/>
His hand was pierced and pinned against his forehead.<lb/>
He shouted madly. Peleus, near him while<lb/>
he stood there pinned and helpless with his wound,<lb/>
struck him with sharp sword in the belly deep.<lb/>
He leaped forth fiercely, as he trailed his bowels<lb/>
upon the ground, with his entangled legs<lb/>
treading upon them, bursting them, he fell<lb/>
with empty belly, lifeless to the earth.<lb/>

    
“Cyllarus, beauty did not save your life—<lb/>
if beauty is in any of your tribe—<lb/>
your golden beard was in its early growth,<lb/>
your golden hair came flowing to your shoulders. <lb/>
in your bright face there was a pleasing glance.<lb/>
The neck and shoulders and the hands and breast,:<lb/>
and every aspect of his human form<lb/>
resembled those admired statues which<lb/>
our gifted artists carve. Even the shape<lb/>
of the fine horse beneath the human form<lb/>
was perfect too. Give him the head and neck<lb/>
of a full-blooded horse, and he would seem<lb/>
a steed for Castor, for his back was shaped<lb/>
so comfortable to be sat upon<lb/>
and muscle swelled upon his arching chest.<lb/>
His lustrous body was as black as pitch,<lb/>
and yet his legs and flowing tail<lb/>
were white as snow.<lb/>

    
Many a female of his kind<lb/>
loved him, but only Hylonome gained<lb/>
his love. There was no other centaur maid<lb/>
so beautiful as she within the woods.<lb/>
By coaxing ways she had won Cyllarus,<lb/>
by loving and confessing love. By daintiness,<lb/>
so far as that was possible in one<lb/>
of such a form, she held his love; for now<lb/>
she smoothed her long locks with a comb; and now<lb/>
she decked herself with rosemary and now<lb/>
with violets or with roses in her hair;<lb/>
and sometimes she wore lilies, white as snow;<lb/>
and twice each day she bathed her lovely face,<lb/>
in the sweet stream that falls down from the height<lb/>
of wooded Pagasa; and daily, twice<lb/>
she dipped her body in the stream. She wore<lb/>
upon her shoulders and left side a skin,<lb/>
greatly becoming, of selected worth.<lb/>

    
“Their love was equal, and together they<lb/>
would wander over mountain-sides, and rest<lb/>
together in cool caves; and so it was,<lb/>
they went together to that palace-cave,<lb/>
known to the Lapithae. Together they<lb/>
fought fiercely in this battle, side by side.<lb/>
Thrown by an unknown hand, a javelin pierced<lb/>
Cyllarus, just below the fatal spot<lb/>
where the chest rises to the neck—his heart,<lb/>
though only slightly wounded, grew quite cold,<lb/>
and his whole body felt cold, afterwards,<lb/>
as quickly as the weapon was drawn out.<lb/>
Then Hylonome held in her embrace<lb/>
the dying body; fondled the dread wound<lb/>
and, fixing her lips closely to his lips<lb/>
endeavored to hold back his dying breath.<lb/>
But soon she saw that he indeed was dead.<lb/>
With mourning words, which clamor of the fight<lb/>
prevented me from hearing, she threw herself<lb/>
on the spear that pierced her Cyllarus and fell<lb/>
upon his breast, embracing him in death.<lb/>


    
“Another sight still comes before my eyes,<lb/>
the centaur Phaeocomes with his log.<lb/>
He wore six lion skins well wrapped around<lb/>
his body, and with fixed connecting knots<lb/>
they covered him, both horse and man. He hurled<lb/>
a trunk two yokes of oxen scarce could move<lb/>
and struck the hapless son of Olenus<lb/>
a crushing blow upon the head. The broad<lb/>
round dome was shattered, and his dying brains<lb/>
oozed out through hollow nostrils, mouth, and ears,<lb/>
as curdled milk seeps down through oaken twigs;<lb/>
or other liquors, crushed out under weights,<lb/>
flow through a well-pierced sieve and, thick,<lb/>
squeeze out through numerous holes.<lb/>

    
As he began<lb/>
to spoil his victim—and your father can<lb/>
affirm the truth of this—I thrust my sword<lb/>
deep in the wretch's groin. Chthonius, too,<lb/>
and Teleboas fell there by my sword.<lb/>
The former had a two-pronged stick as his<lb/>
sole weapon, and the other had a spear,<lb/>
with which the wounded me. You see the scar.<lb/>
The old scar still is surely visible!<lb/>

    
“Those were my days of youth and strength, and then<lb/>
I ought to have warred against the citadel<lb/>
of Pergama. I could have checked, or even<lb/>
vanquished, the arms of Hector: but, alas,<lb/>
Hector had not been born, or was perhaps<lb/>
a boy. Old age has dulled my youthful strength.<lb/>
What use is it, to speak of Periphas,<lb/>
who overcame Pyretus, double-formed?<lb/>
Why tell of Ampyx, who with pointless shaft,<lb/>
victorious thrust Echeclus through the face?<lb/>
Macareus, hurling a heavy crowbar pierced<lb/>
Erigdupus and laid him low.<lb/>
A hunting spear that Nessus strongly hurled,<lb/>
was buried in the groin of Cymelus.<lb/>
Do not believe that Mopsus, son of Ampycus,<lb/>
was merely a prophet of events to come,<lb/>
he slew a daring two-formed monster there.<lb/>
Hodites tried in vain to speak, before<lb/>
his death, but could not, for his tongue was nailed<lb/>
against his chin, his chin against his throat.<lb/>

    
“Five of the centaurs Caeneus put to death:<lb/>
Styphelus, Bromus, and Antimachus,<lb/>
Elymus, and Pyracmos with his axe.<lb/>
I have forgot their wounds but noted well<lb/>
their names and number. Latreus, huge of limb,<lb/>
had killed and stripped Emathian Halesus.<lb/>
Now in his armor he came rushing out,<lb/>
in years he was between old age and youth;<lb/>
but he retained the vigor of his youth;<lb/>
his temples showed his hair was mixed with grey.<lb/>
Conspicuous for his Macedonian lance<lb/>
and sword and shield, facing both sides—each way,<lb/>
he insolently clashed his arms; and while<lb/>
he rode poured out these words in empty air.<lb/>

    
“ ‘Shall I put up with one like you, O Caeneus?<lb/>
For you are still a woman in my sight.<lb/>
Have you forgot your birth or that disgrace<lb/>
by which you won reward—at what a price<lb/>
you got the false resemblance to a man?!<lb/>
Consider both your birth, and what you have<lb/>
submitted to! Take up a distaff, and<lb/>
wool basket! Twist your threads with practiced thumb!<lb/>
Leave warfare to your men!’<lb/>

    
“While puffed-up pride<lb/>
was vaunting out such nonsense, Caeneus hurled<lb/>
a spear and pierced the stretched out running side,<lb/>
just where the man was joined upon the horse.<lb/>

    
“The Centaur, Latreus, raved with pain and struck<lb/>
with his great pike, the face of Caeneus.<lb/>
His pike rebounded as the hail that slants<lb/>
up from the roof; or as a pebble might<lb/>
rebound from hollow drum. Then coming near,<lb/>
he tried to drive a sword into the hard side<lb/>
of Caeneus, but it could not make a wound.<lb/>
‘Aha!’ he cried, ‘this will not get you off.<lb/>
The good edge of my sword will take your life,<lb/>
although the point is blunt!’ He turned the edge<lb/>
against the flank of Caeneus and swung round<lb/>
the hero's loins with his long, curving arm.<lb/>
The flesh resounded like a marble block,<lb/>
the keen blade shattered on the unyielding skin.<lb/>

    
“And, after Caeneus had exposed his limbs<lb/>
unhurt to Latreus, who stood there amazed,<lb/>
‘Come now,’ he said, ‘and let us try my steel<lb/>
against your body!’ And, clear to the hilt,<lb/>
down through the monster's shoulder-blade he plunged<lb/>
his deadly sword and, turning it again,<lb/>
deep in the Centaur's entrails, made new wounds<lb/>
within his wound.<lb/>

    
“Then, quite beside themselves,<lb/>
the double-natured monsters rushed against<lb/>
that single-handed youth with huge uproar,<lb/>
and thrust and hurled their weapons all at him.<lb/>
Their blunted weapons fell and he remained<lb/>
unharmed and without even a mark.”<lb/>

    
“That strange sight left them speechless. ‘Oh what shame!’<lb/>
at length cried Monychus, ‘Our mighty host,—<lb/>
a nation of us, are defeated and defied<lb/>
by one who hardly is a man. Although<lb/>
indeed, he is a man, and we have proved,<lb/>
by our weak actions, we are certainly<lb/>
what he was! Shame on us! Oh, what if we<lb/>
have twofold strength, of what avail our huge<lb/>
and mighty limbs, doubly united in<lb/>
the strongest, hugest bodies in this world?<lb/>
And how can I believe that we were born<lb/>
of any goddess? It is surely vain<lb/>
to claim descent of great Ixion, who<lb/>
high-souled, sought Juno for his mighty mate;<lb/>
imagine it, while we are conquered by<lb/>
an enemy, who is but half a man!<lb/>
Wake up! and let us heap tree-trunks and stones<lb/>
and mountains on him! Crush his stubborn life!<lb/>
Let forests smother him to death! Their weight<lb/>
will be as deadly as a hundred wounds!’<lb/>

    
“While he was raving, by some chance he found<lb/>
a tree thrown down there by the boisterous wind:<lb/>
example to the rest, he threw that tree<lb/>
against the powerful foe; and in short time<lb/>
Othrys was bare of trees, and Pelion had no shade.<lb/>
Buried under that mountainous forest heap,<lb/>
Caeneus heaved up against the weight of oaks<lb/>
upon his brawny shoulders piled. But, as<lb/>
the load increased above his face and head,<lb/>
he could not draw a breath. Gasping for life,<lb/>
he strove to lift his head into the air,<lb/>
and sometimes he convulsed the towering mass,<lb/>
as if great Ida, now before our eyes,<lb/>
should tremble with some heaving of the earth.<lb/>

    
“What happened to him could not well be known.<lb/>
Some thought his body was borne down by weight<lb/>
into the vast expanse of Tartarus.<lb/>
The son of Ampycus did not agree,<lb/>
for from the middle of the pile we saw<lb/>
a bird with golden wings mount high in air.<lb/>
Before or since, I never saw the like.<lb/>

    
“When Mopsus was aware of that bird's flight—<lb/>
it circled round the camp on rustling wings—<lb/>
with eyes and mind he followed it and shouted aloud:<lb/>
‘Hail, glory of the Lapithaean race,<lb/>
their greatest hero, now a bird unique!’<lb/>
and we believed the verdict of the seer.<lb/>

    
“Our grief increased resentment, and we bore<lb/>
it with disgust that one was overwhelmed<lb/>
by such a multitude. Then in revenge<lb/>
we plied our swords, till half our foes were dead,<lb/>
and only flight and darkness saved the rest.”<lb/>


Periclymenus.
PERICLYMENUS IN COMBAT WITH HERCULES

Nestor had hardly told this marvellous tale<lb/>
of bitter strife betwixt the Lapithae<lb/>
and those half-human, vanquished Centaurs, when<lb/>
Tlepolemus, incensed because no word<lb/>
of praise was given to Hercules, replied<lb/>
in this way; “Old sir, it is very strange,<lb/>
you have neglected to say one good word<lb/>
in praise of Hercules. My father told<lb/>
me often, that he overcame in battle<lb/>
those cloud born centaurs.”<lb/>

    
Nestor, very loth,<lb/>
replied, “Why force me to recall old wrongs,<lb/>
to uncover sorrow buried by the years,<lb/>
that made me hate your father? It is true<lb/>
his deeds were wonderful beyond belief,<lb/>
heaven knows, and filled the earth with well earned praise<lb/>
which I should rather wish might be denied.<lb/>
Deiphobus, the wise Polydamas, and even<lb/>
great Hector get no praise from me.<lb/>
Your father, I recall once overthrew<lb/>
Messene's walls and with no cause destroyed<lb/>
Elis and Pylos and with fire and sword<lb/>
ruined my own loved home. I cannot name<lb/>
all whom he killed. But there were twelve of us,<lb/>
the sons of Neleus and all warrior youths,<lb/>
and all those twelve but me alone he killed.<lb/>
Ten of them met the common fate of war,<lb/>
but sadder was the death of Periclymenus.<lb/>

    
“Neptune, the founder of my family,<lb/>
had granted him a power to assume<lb/>
whatever shape he chose, and when he wished<lb/>
to lay that shape aside. When he, in vain,<lb/>
had been transformed to many other shapes<lb/>
he turned into the form of that bird, which<lb/>
is wont to carry in his crooked talons<lb/>
the forked lightnings, favorite bird of Jove.<lb/>
With wings and crooked bill and sharp-hooked talons,<lb/>
he assailed and tore the face of Hercules.<lb/>
But, when he soared away on eagle wings<lb/>
up to the clouds and hovered, poised in air,<lb/>
that hero aimed his too unerring bow<lb/>
and hit him where the new wing joined his side.<lb/>
The wound was not large, but his sinews cut<lb/>
failed to uphold him, and denied his wings<lb/>
their strength and motion. He fell down to earth;<lb/>
his weakened pinions could not catch the air.<lb/>
And the sharp arrow, which had lightly pierced<lb/>
the wing, was driven upward through the side<lb/>
into the left part of my brother's neck.<lb/>

    
“O noble leader of the Rhodian fleet,<lb/>
why should I sing the praise of Hercules?<lb/>
But for my brothers I take no revenge<lb/>
except withholding praise of his great deeds.<lb/>
With you, my friendship will remain secure.”<lb/>

THE DEATH OF ACHILLES

When Nestor with his honied tongue had told<lb/>
these tales of old, they all took wine again<lb/>
and they arose and gave the night to sleep.<lb/>


Achillis mors.

But Neptune, who commands the ocean waves,<lb/>
lamented with a father's grief his son,<lb/>
whose person he had changed into a bird—<lb/>
the swan of Phaethon, and towards Achilles,<lb/>
grim victor in the fight, his lasting hate<lb/>
made him pursue resentment far beyond<lb/>
the ordinary manner of the gods.<lb/>
After nine years of war he spoke these words,<lb/>
addressing long haired Sminthean Apollo:<lb/>

    
“O nephew the most dear to me of all<lb/>
my brother's sons, with me you built in vain<lb/>
the walls of Troy: you must be lost in grief,<lb/>
when you look on those towers so soon to fall?<lb/>
Or do you not lament the multitudes<lb/>
slain in defence of them—To name but one:<lb/>

    
“Does not the ghost of Hector, dragged around<lb/>
his Pergama, appear to you? And yet<lb/>
the fierce Achilles, who is bloodstained more<lb/>
than slaughtering war, lives on this earth,<lb/>
for the destruction of our toil. Let him<lb/>
once get into my power, and I will make<lb/>
him feel the action of my triple spear.<lb/>
But, since I may not meet him face to face,<lb/>
do you with sudden arrow give him death.”<lb/>

    
The Delian god, Apollo, gave assent,<lb/>
both for his own hate and his uncle's rage.<lb/>
Veiled in a cloud, he found the Trojan host<lb/>
and, there, while bloody strife went on, he saw<lb/>
the hero Paris shoot at intervals<lb/>
his arrows at the nameless host of Greeks.<lb/>
Revealing his divinity, he said:<lb/>

    
“Why spend your arrows on the common men<lb/>
if you would serve your people, take good aim<lb/>
at great Achilles and at last avenge<lb/>
your hapless brothers whom he gave to death.”<lb/>
He pointed out Achilles—laying low<lb/>
the Trojan warriors with his mighty spear.<lb/>
On him he turned the Trojan's willing bow<lb/>
and guided with his hand the fatal shaft.<lb/>
It was the first joy that old Priam knew<lb/>
since Hector's death. So then Achilles you,<lb/>
who overcame the mighty, were subdued<lb/>
by a coward who seduced a Grecian wife!<lb/>
Ah, if you could not die by manly hands,<lb/>
your choice had been the axe.<lb/>

    
Now that great terror of the Trojan race,<lb/>
the glory and defence of the Pelasgians,<lb/>
Achilles, first in war, lay on the pyre.<lb/>
The god of Fire first armed, then burned, his limbs.<lb/>
And now he is but ashes; and of him, so great,<lb/>
renowned and mighty, but a pitiful<lb/>
handful of small dust insufficient for<lb/>
a little urn! But all his glory lives<lb/>
enough to fill the world—a great reward.<lb/>
And in that glory is his real life:<lb/>
in a true sense he will never know the void<lb/>
of Tartarus.<lb/>

    
But soon his very shield—<lb/>
that men might know to whom it had belonged—<lb/>
brings war, and arms are taken for his arms.<lb/>
Neither Diomed nor Ajax called the less<lb/>
ventured to claim the hero's mighty shield.<lb/>
Menelaus and other warlike chiefs,<lb/>
even Agamemnon, all withdrew their claims.<lb/>
Only the greater Ajax and Ulysses<lb/>
had such assurance that they dared contest<lb/>
for that great prize. Then Agamemnon chose<lb/>
to avoid the odium of preferring one.<lb/>
He bade the Argolic chieftains take their seats<lb/>
within the camp and left to all of them<lb/>
the hearing and decision of the cause.<lb/>

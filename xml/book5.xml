BATTLE OF THE WEDDING FEASTPERSEUS AND ANDROMEDA

While Perseus, the brave son of Jupiter,<lb/>
surrounded at the feast by Cepheus' lords,<lb/>
narrated this, a raging multitude<lb/>
with sudden outcry filled the royal courts—<lb/>
not with the clamours of a wedding feast<lb/>
but boisterous rage, portentous of dread war.<lb/>

    
As when the fury of a great wind strikes<lb/>
a tranquil sea, tempestuous billows roll<lb/>
across the peaceful bosom of the deep;<lb/>
so were the pleasures at the banquet changed<lb/>
to sudden tumult.<lb/>

    
Foremost of that throng,<lb/>
the rash ring-leader, Phineus, shook his spear,<lb/>
brass-tipped of ash, and shouted, “Ha, 'tis I!<lb/>
I come avenger of my ravished bride!<lb/>
Let now your flittering wings deliver you,<lb/>
or even Jupiter, dissolved in showers<lb/>
of imitation gold.” So boasted he,<lb/>
aiming his spear at Perseus.<lb/>

    
Thus to him<lb/>
cried Cepheus: “Hold your hand, and strike him not!<lb/>
What strange delusions, O my brother, have<lb/>
compelled you to this crime? Is it the just<lb/>
requital of heroic worth? A fair<lb/>
reguerdon for the life of her you loved?<lb/>

    
“If truth were known, not Perseus ravished her<lb/>
from you; but, either 'twas the awful God<lb/>
that rules the Nereides; or Ammon, crowned<lb/>
with crescent horns; or that monstrosity<lb/>
of Ocean's vast abyss, which came to glut<lb/>
his famine on the issue of my loins.<lb/>
Nor was your suit abandoned till the time<lb/>
when she must perish and be lost to you.<lb/>
So cruel are you, seeking my daughter's death,<lb/>
rejoicing lightly in our deep despair.—<lb/>

    
“And was it not enough for you to stand<lb/>
supinely by, while she was bound in chains,<lb/>
and offer no assistance, though you were<lb/>
her lover and betrothed? And will you grieve<lb/>
that she was rescued from a dreadful fate,<lb/>
and spoil her champion of his just rewards?<lb/>
Rewards that now may seem magnificent,<lb/>
but not denied to you if you had won<lb/>
and saved, when she was fettered to the rock.<lb/>

    
“Let him, whose strength to my declining years<lb/>
restored my child, receive the merit due<lb/>
his words and deeds; and know his suit was not<lb/>
preferred to yours, but granted to prevent<lb/>
her certain death.”<lb/>

    
not deigning to reply,<lb/>
against them Phineus stood; and glancing back<lb/>
from him to Perseus, with alternate looks,<lb/>
as doubtful which should feel his first attack,<lb/>
made brief delay. Then vain at Perseus hurled<lb/>
his spear, with all the force that rage inspired,<lb/>
but, missing him it quivered in a couch.<lb/>

    
Provoked beyond endurance Perseus leaped<lb/>
forth from the cushioned seats, and fiercely sent<lb/>
that outwrenched weapon back. It would have pierced<lb/>
his hostile breast had not the miscreant crouched<lb/>
behind the altars. Oh perverted good,<lb/>
that thus an altar should abet the wrong!<lb/>

    
But, though the craven Phineus escaped,<lb/>
not vainly flew the whizzing point, but struck<lb/>
in Rhoetus' forehead. As the barb was torn<lb/>
out of the bone, the victim's heels began<lb/>
to kick upon the floor, and spouting blood<lb/>
defiled the festal board. Then truly flame<lb/>
in uncontrolled rage the vulgar crowd,<lb/>
and hurl their harmful darts.<lb/>

    
And there are some<lb/>
who hold that Cepheus and his son-in-law<lb/>
deserved to die; but Cepheus had passed forth<lb/>
the threshold of his palace: having called<lb/>
on all the Gods of Hospitality<lb/>
and Truth and Justice to attest, he gave<lb/>
no comfort to the enemies of Peace.<lb/>

    
Unconquered Pallas is at hand and holds<lb/>
her Aegis to protect her brother's life;<lb/>
she lends him dauntless courage. At the feast<lb/>
was one from India's distant shores, whose name<lb/>
was Athis. It was said that Limnate,<lb/>
the daughter of the River Ganges, him<lb/>
in vitreous caverns bright had brought to birth;<lb/>
and now at sixteen summers in his prime,<lb/>
the handsome youth was clad in costly robes.<lb/>

    
A purple mantle with a golden fringe<lb/>
covered his shoulders, and a necklace, carved<lb/>
of gold, enhanced the beauty of his throat.<lb/>
His hair encompassed with a coronal,<lb/>
delighted with sweet myrrh. Well taught was he<lb/>
to hurl the javelin at a distant mark,<lb/>
and none with better skill could stretch the bow.<lb/>

    
No sooner had he bent the pliant horns<lb/>
than Perseus, with a smoking billet, seized<lb/>
from the mid-altar, struck him on the face,<lb/>
and smashed his features in his broken skull.<lb/>

    
And when Assyrian Lycabas had seen<lb/>
his dear companion, whom he truly loved,<lb/>
beating his handsome countenance in blood.<lb/>
And when he had bewailed his lost life,<lb/>
that ebbed away from that unpiteous wound,<lb/>
he snatched the bow that Athis used, and said;<lb/>

“Let us in single combat seek revenge;<lb/>
not long will you rejoice the stripling's fate;<lb/>
a deed most worthy shame.” So speaking, forth<lb/>
the piercing arrow bounded from the cord,<lb/>
which, though avoided, struck the hero's cloak<lb/>
and fastened in its folds.—<lb/>

    
Then Perseus turned<lb/>
upon him, with the trusted curving sword,<lb/>
cause of Medusa's death, and drove the blade<lb/>
deep in his breast. The dying victim's eyes,<lb/>
now swimming in a shadowous night, looked 'round<lb/>
for Athis, whom, beholding, he reclined<lb/>
upon, and ushered to the other world,—<lb/>
sad consolation of united death.<lb/>


    
And Phorbas the descendant of Methion.<lb/>
Who hailed from far Syene, with his friend<lb/>
Amphimedon of Libya, in their haste<lb/>
to join the battle, slipped up in the blood<lb/>
and fell together: just as they arose<lb/>
that glittering sword was driven through the throat<lb/>
of Phorbas into the ribs of his companion.<lb/>

    
But Erithus, the son of Actor, swung<lb/>
a battle-ax, so weighty, Perseus chose<lb/>
not combat with his curving blade. He seized<lb/>
in his two hands a huge bowl, wrought around<lb/>
with large design, outstanding from its mass.<lb/>

    
This, lifting up, he dashes on his foe,<lb/>
who vomits crimson blood, and falling back<lb/>
beats on the hard floor with his dying head.<lb/>

    
And next he slew Caucasian Abaris,<lb/>
and Polydaemon—from Semiramis<lb/>
nobly descended—and Sperchius, son,<lb/>
Lycetus, long-haired Elyces, unshorn,<lb/>
Clytus and Phlegias, the hero slew;—<lb/>
and trampled on the dying heaped around.<lb/>

    
Not daring to engage his enemy<lb/>
in open contest, Phineus held aloof,<lb/>
and hurled his javelin. Badly aimed—by some<lb/>
mischance or turned—it wounded Idas, who<lb/>
had followed neither side; vain-hoping thus<lb/>
to shun the conflict.<lb/>

    
Idas, filled with rage,<lb/>
on Phineus gazed with futile hate, and said,<lb/>
“Since I am forced unwilling to such deeds,<lb/>
behold, whom you have made your enemy,<lb/>
O savage Phineus! Let your recompense<lb/>
be stroke for stroke.” So speaking, from the wound<lb/>
he drew the steel, but, faint from loss of blood,<lb/>
before his arm could hurl the weapon back,<lb/>
he sank upon his knees.<lb/>

    
Here, also, lies<lb/>
Odytes,—noblest of the Cephenes,<lb/>
save Cepheus only,—slaughtered by the sword<lb/>
of Clymenus. And Prothoenor lies<lb/>
the victim of Hypseus; by his side<lb/>
Hypseus slaughtered by Lyncidas falls.<lb/>

    
And in the midst of this destruction stood<lb/>
Emathion, now an aged man, revered,<lb/>
who feared the Gods, and stood for upright deeds.<lb/>
And, since his years denied him strength for war,<lb/>
he battled with his tongue, and railed, and cursed<lb/>
their impious weapons. As that aged man<lb/>
clings to the altar with his trembling hands,<lb/>
Chromis with ruthless sword cuts off his head,<lb/>
which straightway falls upon the altar, whence<lb/>
his dying tongue denounces them in words<lb/>
of execration: and his soul expires<lb/>
amid the altar flames.<lb/>

    
Then Broteas<lb/>
and Ammon, his twin brother, who not knew<lb/>
their equals at the cestus, by the hand<lb/>
of Phineus fell; for what avails in deed<lb/>
the cestus as a weapon matched with swords.<lb/>
Ampycus by the same hand fell,—the priest<lb/>
of Ceres, with his temples wreathed in white.<lb/>

    
And O, Iapetides not for this<lb/>
did you attend the feast! Your voice attuned<lb/>
melodious to the harp, was in request<lb/>
to celebrate the wedding-day with song,—<lb/>
a work of peace; as you did stand aside,<lb/>
holding the peaceful plectrum in your hand,<lb/>
the mocking Pettalus in ridicule said,<lb/>
“Go sing your ditties to the Stygian shades.”<lb/>
And, mocking thus, he drove his pointed sword<lb/>
in your right temple. As your limbs gave way,<lb/>
your dying fingers swept the tuneful strings:<lb/>
and falling you did chant a mournful dirge.—<lb/>
You to avenge enraged Lycormas tore<lb/>
a huge bar from the door-post, on the right,<lb/>
and dashing it against the mocker crushed<lb/>
his neck-bones: as a slaughtered bullock falls—<lb/>
he tumbled to the ground.<lb/>

    
Then on the left.<lb/>
Cinyphian Pelates began to wrench<lb/>
an oak plank from the door-post, but the spear<lb/>
of Corythus, the son of Marmarus,<lb/>
pinioned his right hand to the wooden post;<lb/>
and while he struggled Abas pierced his side.—<lb/>
He fell not to the floor, but dying hung<lb/>
suspended from the door-post by his hand.<lb/>

    
And of the friends of Perseus, Melaneus<lb/>
was slain, and Dorylas whose wealth was large<lb/>
in Nasamonian land. No other lord,<lb/>
as Dorylas, such vast estates possessed;<lb/>
no other owned so many heaps of corn.<lb/>
The missile steel stood fastened in his groin,<lb/>
obliquely fixed,—a fatal spot—and when<lb/>
the author of his wound, Halcyoneus<lb/>
the Bactrian, beheld his victim thus,<lb/>
rolling his eyes and sobbing forth his soul,<lb/>
he railed; “Keep for yourself of all your lands<lb/>
as much as you can cover.” And he left<lb/>
the bleeding corpse.<lb/>

    
But Perseus in revenge<lb/>
hurled after him a spear, which, in his need,<lb/>
he ripped out from the wound, yet warm, and struck<lb/>
the boaster on the middle of his nose.<lb/>
The piercing steel, passed through his nose and neck,—<lb/>
remained projecting from the front and back.<lb/>

    
And while good fortune helped his hand, he slew<lb/>
Clanis and Clytius, of one mother born,<lb/>
but with a different wound he slaughtered each:<lb/>
for, leveled by a mighty arm, his ashen spear<lb/>
drove through the thighs of Clytius, right and left,<lb/>
and Clanis bit the javelin with his teeth.<lb/>

    
And by his might, Mendesian Celadon<lb/>
and Atreus fell, his mother of the tribes<lb/>
of Palestine, his father was unknown.<lb/>
Aethion, also, who could well foresee<lb/>
the things to come, but was at last deceived<lb/>
by some false omen. And Thoactes fell,<lb/>
the armour-bearer of the king; and, next,<lb/>
the infamous Agyrtes who had slain<lb/>
his father. These he slew; and though his strength<lb/>
was nearly spent, so many more remained:<lb/>
for now the multitude with one accord<lb/>
conspired to slaughter him. From every side<lb/>
the raging troops assailed the better cause.<lb/>

    
In vain the pious father and the bride,<lb/>
together with her mother, fill the halls<lb/>
with lamentations; for the clash of arms,<lb/>
the groans of fallen heroes drown their cries.—<lb/>
Bellona in a sea of blood has drenched<lb/>
their Household Gods, polluted by these deeds,<lb/>
and she endeavours to renew the strife.<lb/>

    
Perseus, alone against that raging throng,<lb/>
is now surrounded by a myriad men,<lb/>
led on by Phineus; and their flying darts,<lb/>
as thick as wintry tail, are showered around<lb/>
on every side, grazing his eyes and ears.—<lb/>
Quickly he fixed his shoulder firm against<lb/>
the rock of a great pillar, which secured<lb/>
his back from danger, and he faced his foes,<lb/>
and baffled their attack.<lb/>

    
Upon his left<lb/>
Chaonian Molpeus pressed, and on his right<lb/>
a Nabathe an called Ethemon pressed.—<lb/>

    
As when a tiger from a valley hears<lb/>
the lowing of two herds, in separate fields,<lb/>
though hunger urges he not knows on which<lb/>
to spring, but rages equally for each;<lb/>
so, Perseus doubtful which may first attack<lb/>
his left or right, knows not on which to turn,<lb/>
but stands attentive witness to the flight<lb/>
of Molpeus, whom he wounded in the leg.<lb/>

    
Nor could he choose—Ethemon, full of rage,<lb/>
pressed on him to inflict a fatal wound,<lb/>
deep in his neck; but with incautious force<lb/>
struck the stone pillar with his ringing sword<lb/>
and shattered the metal blade, close to the hilt;<lb/>
the flying fragment pierced its owner's neck,<lb/>
but not with mortal wound. In vain he pled<lb/>
for mercy, stretching forth his helpless arms:<lb/>
perseus transfixed him with his glittering blade,<lb/>
Cyllenian.<lb/>


    
But when he saw his strength<lb/>
was yielding to the multitude, he said,<lb/>
“Since you have forced disaster on yourselves,<lb/>
why should I hesitate to save myself?—<lb/>
O friends, avert your faces if ye stand<lb/>
before me!” And he raised Medusa,s head.<lb/>

    
Thescelus answered him; “Seek other dupes<lb/>
to chase with wonders!” Just as he prepared<lb/>
to hurl the deadly javelin from his hand,<lb/>
he stood, unmoving in that attitude,<lb/>
a marble statue.<lb/>

    
Ampyx, close to him,<lb/>
exulting in a mighty spirit, made<lb/>
a lunge to pierce Lyncides in the breast;<lb/>
but, as his sword was flashing in the air,<lb/>
his right arm grew so rigid, there he stood<lb/>
unable to draw back or thrust it forth.<lb/>

    
But Nileus, who had feigned himself begot<lb/>
by seven-fold Nile, and carved his shield with gold<lb/>
and silver streams, alternate seven, shouted;<lb/>
“Look, look! O Perseus, him from whom I sprung!<lb/>
And you shall carry to the silent shades<lb/>
a mighty consolation in your death,<lb/>
that you were slain by such a one as I.”<lb/>
But in the midst of boasting, the last words<lb/>
were silenced; and his open mouth, although<lb/>
incapable of motion, seemed intent<lb/>
to utter speech.<lb/>

    
Then Eryx, chiding says;<lb/>
“Your craven spirits have benumbed you, not<lb/>
Medusa's poison.—Come with me and strike<lb/>
this youthful mover of magician charms<lb/>
down to the ground.”—He started with a rush;<lb/>
the earth detained his steps; it held him fast;<lb/>
he could not speak; he stood, complete with arms,<lb/>
a statue.<lb/>

    
Such a penalty was theirs,<lb/>
and justly earned; but near by there was one,<lb/>
aconteus, who defending Perseus, saw<lb/>
medusa as he fought; and at the sight<lb/>
the soldier hardened to an upright stone.—<lb/>
Assured he was alive, Astyages<lb/>
now struck him with his long sword, but the blade<lb/>
resounded with a ringing note; and there,<lb/>
astonished at the sound, Astyages,<lb/>
himself, assumed that nature; and remained<lb/>
with wonder pictured on his marble face.<lb/>

    
And not to weary with the names of men,<lb/>
sprung from the middle classes, there remained<lb/>
two hundred warriors eager for the fight—<lb/>
as soon as they could see Medusa's face,<lb/>
two hundred warriors stiffened into stone.<lb/>

    
At last, repentant, Phineus dreads the war,<lb/>
unjust, for in a helpless fright he sees<lb/>
the statues standing in strange attitudes;<lb/>
and, recognizing his adherents, calls<lb/>
on each by name to rescue from that death.<lb/>
Still unbelieving he begins to touch<lb/>
the bodies, nearest to himself, and all<lb/>
are hard stone.<lb/>

    
Having turned his eyes away,<lb/>
he stretched his hands and arms obliquely back<lb/>
to Perseus, and confessed his wicked deeds;<lb/>
and thus imploring spoke;<lb/>

“Remove, I pray,<lb/>
O Perseus, thou invincible, remove<lb/>
from me that dreadful Gorgon: take away<lb/>
the stone-creating countenance of thy<lb/>
unspeakable Medusa! For we warred<lb/>
not out of hatred, nor to gain a throne,<lb/>
but clashed our weapons for a woman's sake.—<lb/>

    
“Thy merit proved thy valid claim, and time<lb/>
gave argument for mine. It grieves me not<lb/>
to yield, O bravest, only give me life,<lb/>
and all the rest be thine.” Such words implored<lb/>
the craven, never daring to address<lb/>
his eyes to whom he spoke.<lb/>

    
And thus returned<lb/>
the valiant Perseus; “I will grant to you,<lb/>
O timid-hearted Phineus! as behoves<lb/>
your conduct; and it should appear a gift,<lb/>
magnanimous, to one who fears to move.—<lb/>
Take courage, for no steel shall violate<lb/>
your carcase; and, moreover, you shall be<lb/>
a monument, that ages may record<lb/>
your unforgotten name. You shall be seen<lb/>
thus always, in the palace where resides<lb/>
my father-in-law, that my surrendered spouse<lb/>
may soften her great grief when she but sees<lb/>
the darling image of her first betrothed.”<lb/>

    
He spoke, and moved Medusa to that side<lb/>
where Phineus had turned his trembling face:<lb/>
and as he struggled to avert his gaze<lb/>
his neck grew stiff; the moisture of his eyes<lb/>
was hardened into stone.—And since that day<lb/>
his timid face and coward eyes and hands,<lb/>
forever shall be guilty as in life.<lb/>

    
After such deeds, victorious Perseus turned,<lb/>
and sought the confines of his native land;<lb/>
together with his bride; which, having reached,<lb/>
he punished Proetus—who by force of arms<lb/>
had routed his own brother from the throne<lb/>
of Argos. By his aid Acrisius,<lb/>
although his undeserving parent, gained<lb/>
his citadels once more: for Proetus failed,<lb/>
with all his arms and towers unjustly held,<lb/>
to quell the grim-eyed monster, snake-begin.<lb/>

    
Yet not the valour of the youth, upheld<lb/>
by many labours, nor his grievous wrongs<lb/>
have softened you, O Polydectes! king<lb/>
of Little Seriphus; but bitter hate<lb/>
ungoverned, rankles in your hardened heart—<lb/>
there is no limit to your unjust rage.<lb/>
Even his praises are defamed by you<lb/>
and all your arguments are given to prove<lb/>
Medusa's death a fraud.—Perseus rejoined;<lb/>
“By this we give our true pledge of the truth,<lb/>
avert your eyes!” And by Medusa's face<lb/>
he made the features of that impious king<lb/>
a bloodless stone.<lb/>


Hippocrene. Pierides.
THE NINE MUSES AND MINERVA

Through all these mighty deeds<lb/>
Pallas, Minerva, had availed to guide<lb/>
her gold-begotten brother. Now she sped,<lb/>
surrounded in a cloud, from Seriphus,<lb/>
while Cynthus on the right, and Gyarus<lb/>
far faded from her view. And where a path,<lb/>
high over the deep sea, leads the near way,<lb/>
she winged the air for Thebes, and Helicon<lb/>
haunt of the Virgin Nine.<lb/>

    
High on that mount<lb/>
she stayed her flight, and with these words bespoke<lb/>
those well-taught sisters; “Fame has given to me<lb/>
the knowledge of a new-made fountain—gift<lb/>
of Pegasus, that fleet steed, from the blood<lb/>
of dread Medusa sprung—it opened when<lb/>
his hard hoof struck the ground.—It is the cause<lb/>
that brought me.—For my longing to have seen<lb/>
this fount, miraculous and wonderful,<lb/>
grows not the less in that myself did see<lb/>
the swift steed, nascent from maternal blood.”<lb/>

    
To which Urania thus; “Whatever the cause<lb/>
that brings thee to our habitation, thou,<lb/>
O goddess, art to us the greatest joy.<lb/>
And now, to answer thee, reports are true;<lb/>
this fountain is the work of Pegasus,”<lb/>

    
And having said these words, she gladly thence<lb/>
conducted Pallas to the sacred streams.<lb/>

    
And Pallas, after she had long admired<lb/>
that fountain, flowing where the hoof had struck,<lb/>
turned round to view the groves of ancient trees;<lb/>
the grottoes and the grass bespangled, rich<lb/>
with flowers unnumbered—all so beautiful<lb/>
she deemed the charm of that locality<lb/>
a fair surrounding for the studious days<lb/>
of those Mnemonian Maids.<lb/>

THE NINE MUSES AND PYRENAEUS

But one of them<lb/>
addressed her thus; “O thou whose valour gave<lb/>
thy mind to greater deeds! if thou hadst stooped<lb/>
to us, Minerva, we had welcomed thee<lb/>
most worthy of our choir! Thy words are true;<lb/>
and well hast thou approved the joys of art,<lb/>
and this retreat. Most happy would we be<lb/>
if only we were safe; but wickedness<lb/>
admits of no restraint, and everything<lb/>
affrights our virgin minds; and everywhere<lb/>
the dreadful Pyrenaeus haunts our sight;—<lb/>
scarcely have we recovered from the shock.<lb/>

    
“That savage, with his troops of Thrace. had seized<lb/>
the lands of Daulis and of Phocis, where<lb/>
he ruled in tyranny; and when we sought<lb/>
the Temples of Parnassus, he observed<lb/>
us on our way;—and knowing our estate,<lb/>
pretending to revere our sacred lives,<lb/>
he said; ‘O Muses, I beseech you pause!<lb/>
Choose now the shelter of my roof and shun<lb/>
the heavy stars that teem with pouring rain;<lb/>
nor hesitate, for often the glorious Gods<lb/>
have entered humbler homes.’<lb/>

    
“Moved by his words,<lb/>
and by the growing storm, we gave assent,<lb/>
and entered his first house. But presently<lb/>
the storm abated, and the southern wind<lb/>
was conquered by the north; the black clouds fled,<lb/>
and soon the skies were clear.<lb/>

    
“At once we sought<lb/>
to quit the house, but Pyrenaeus closed<lb/>
all means of exit,—and prepared to force<lb/>
our virtue. Instantly we spread our wings,<lb/>
and so escaped; but on a lofty tower<lb/>
he stood, as if to follow, and exclaimed;<lb/>
‘A path for you marks out a way for me.,<lb/>
and quite insane, he leaped down from the top<lb/>
of that high tower.—Falling on his face,<lb/>
the bones were crushed, and as his life ebbed out<lb/>
the ground was crimsoned with his wicked blood.”<lb/>

THE NINE MUSES AND THE NINE MAGPIES

So spoke the Muse. And now was heard the sound<lb/>
of pennons in the air, and voices, too,<lb/>
gave salutations from the lofty trees.<lb/>

    
Minerva, thinking they were human tongues,<lb/>
looked up in question whence the perfect words;<lb/>
but on the boughs, nine ugly magpies perched,<lb/>
those mockers of all sounds, which now complained<lb/>
their hapless fate. And as she wondering stood,<lb/>
Urania, goddess of the Muse, rejoined;—<lb/>

    
“Look, those but lately worsted in dispute<lb/>
augment the number of unnumbered birds.—<lb/>
Pierus was their father, very rich<lb/>
in lands of Pella; and their mother (called<lb/>
Evippe of Paeonia) when she brought<lb/>
them forth, nine times evoked, in labours nine,<lb/>
Lucina's aid.—Unduly puffed with pride,<lb/>
because it chanced their number equalled ours,<lb/>
these stupid sisters, hither to engage<lb/>
in wordy contest, fared through many towns;—<lb/>
through all Haemonia and Achaia came<lb/>
to us, and said;—<lb/>

‘Oh, cease your empty songs,<lb/>
attuned to dulcet numbers, that deceive<lb/>
the vulgar, untaught throng. If aught is yours<lb/>
of confidence, O Thespian Deities<lb/>
contend with us: our number equals yours.<lb/>
We will not be defeated by your arts;<lb/>
nor shall your songs prevail.—Then, conquered, give<lb/>
Hyantean Aganippe; yield to us<lb/>
the Medusean Fount;—and should we fail,<lb/>
we grant Emathia's plains, to where uprise<lb/>
Paeonia's peaks of snow.—Let chosen Nymphs<lb/>
award the prize—.’ 'Twas shameful to contend;<lb/>
it seemed more shameful to submit. At once,<lb/>
the chosen Nymphs swore justice by their streams,<lb/>
and sat in judgment on their thrones of rock.<lb/>

    
“At once, although the lot had not been cast,<lb/>
the leading sister hastened to begin.—<lb/>
She chanted of celestial wars; she gave<lb/>
the Giants false renown; she gave the Gods<lb/>
small credit for great deeds.—She droned out, ‘Forth,<lb/>
those deepest realms of earth, Typhoeus came,<lb/>
and filled the Gods with fear. They turned their backs<lb/>
in flight to Egypt; and the wearied rout,<lb/>
where Great Nile spreads his seven-channeled mouth,<lb/>
were there received.—Thither the earth-begot<lb/>
Typhoeus hastened: but the Gods of Heaven<lb/>
deceptive shapes assumed.—Lo, Jupiter,<lb/>
(As Libyan Ammon's crooked horns attest)<lb/>
was hidden in the leader of a flock;<lb/>
Apollo in a crow; Bacchus in a goat;<lb/>
Diana in a cat; Venus in a fish;<lb/>
Saturnian Juno in a snow-white cow;<lb/>
Cyllenian Hermes in an Ibis' wings.’—<lb/>
Such stuff she droned out from her noisy mouth:<lb/>
and then they summoned us; but, haply, time<lb/>
permits thee not, nor leisure thee permits,<lb/>
that thou shouldst hearken to our melodies.”<lb/>

“Nay doubt it not,” quoth Pallas, “but relate<lb/>
your melodies in order.” And she sat<lb/>
beneath the pleasant shadows of the grove.<lb/>

    
And thus again Urania; “On our side<lb/>
we trusted all to one.” Which having said,<lb/>
Calliope arose. Her glorious hair<lb/>
was bound with ivy. She attuned the chords,<lb/>
and chanted as she struck the sounding strings:—<lb/>


Ceres et Proserpina.
CALLIOPE SINGS OF CERES, PLUTO AND PROSERPINE

“First Ceres broke with crooked plow the glebe;<lb/>
first gave to earth its fruit and wholesome food;<lb/>
first gave the laws;—all things of Ceres came;<lb/>
of her I sing; and oh, that I could tell<lb/>
her worth in verse; in verse her worth is due.<lb/>

    
“Because he dared to covet heavenly thrones<lb/>
Typhoeus, giant limbs are weighted down<lb/>
beneath Sicilia's Isle—vast in extent—<lb/>
how often thence he strains and strives to rise?<lb/>
But his right hand Pachynus holds; his legs are pressed<lb/>
by Lilybaeus, Aetna weights his head.<lb/>
Beneath that ponderous mass Typhoeus lies,<lb/>
flat on his back; and spues the sands on high;<lb/>
and vomits flames from his ferocious mouth.<lb/>
He often strives to push the earth away,<lb/>
the cities and the mountains from his limbs—<lb/>
by which the lands are shaken. Even the king,<lb/>
that rules the silent shades is made to quake,<lb/>
for fear the earth may open and the ground,<lb/>
cleft in wide chasms, letting in the day,<lb/>
may terrify the trembling ghosts. Afraid<lb/>
of this disaster, that dark despot left<lb/>
his gloomy habitation; carried forth<lb/>
by soot-black horses, in his gloomy car.<lb/>

    
“He circumspectly viewed Sicilia's vast<lb/>
foundations.—Having well explored and proved<lb/>
no part was shattered; having laid aside<lb/>
his careful fears, he wandered in those parts.<lb/>

    
“Him, Venus, Erycina, in her mount<lb/>
thus witnessed, and embraced her winged son,<lb/>
and said, ‘O Cupid! thou who art my son—<lb/>
my arms, my hand, my strength; take up those arms,<lb/>
by which thou art victorious over all,<lb/>
and aim thy keenest arrow at the heart<lb/>
of that divinity whom fortune gave<lb/>
the last award, what time the triple realm,<lb/>
by lot was portioned out.<lb/>

    
‘The Gods of Heaven<lb/>
are overcome by thee; and Jupiter,<lb/>
and all the Deities that swim the deep,<lb/>
and the great ruler of the Water-Gods:<lb/>
why, then, should Tartarus escape our sway—<lb/>
the third part of the universe at stake—<lb/>
by which thy mother's empire and thy own<lb/>
may be enlarged according to great need.<lb/>

    
‘How shameful is our present lot in Heaven,<lb/>
the powers of love and I alike despised;<lb/>
for, mark how Pallas has renounced my sway,<lb/>
besides Diana, javelin-hurler—so<lb/>
will Ceres' daughter choose virginity,<lb/>
if we permit,—that way her hopes incline.<lb/>
Do thou this goddess Proserpine, unite<lb/>
in marriage to her uncle. Venus spoke;—<lb/>

    
“Cupid then loosed his quiver, and of all<lb/>
its many arrows, by his mother's aid,<lb/>
selected one; the keenest of them all;<lb/>
the least uncertain, surest from the string:<lb/>
and having fixed his knee against the bow,<lb/>
bent back the flexile horn.—The flying shaft<lb/>
struck Pluto in the breast.<lb/>

    
“There is a lake<lb/>
of greatest depth, not far from Henna's walls,<lb/>
long since called Pergus; and the songs of swans,<lb/>
that wake Cayster, rival not the notes<lb/>
of swans melodious on its gliding waves:<lb/>
a fringe of trees, encircling as a wreath<lb/>
its compassed waters, with a leafy veil<lb/>
denies the heat of noon; cool breezes blow<lb/>
beneath the boughs; the humid ground is sprent<lb/>
with purpling flowers, and spring eternal reigns.<lb/>

    
“While Proserpine once dallied in that grove,<lb/>
plucking white lilies and sweet violets,<lb/>
and while she heaped her basket, while she filled<lb/>
her bosom, in a pretty zeal to strive<lb/>
beyond all others; she was seen, beloved,<lb/>
and carried off by Pluto—such the haste<lb/>
of sudden love. <lb/>

“The goddess, in great fear,<lb/>
called on her mother and on all her friends;<lb/>
and, in her frenzy, as her robe was rent,<lb/>
down from the upper edge, her gathered flowers<lb/>
fell from her loosened tunic.—This mishap,<lb/>
so perfect was her childish innocence,<lb/>
increased her virgin grief.—<lb/>

    
“The ravisher<lb/>
urged on his chariot, and inspired his steeds;<lb/>
called each by name, and on their necks and manes<lb/>
shook the black-rusted reins. They hastened through<lb/>
deep lakes, and through the pools of Palici,<lb/>
which boiling upward from the ruptured earth<lb/>
smell of strong sulphur. And they bore him thence<lb/>
to where the sons of Bacchus, who had sailed<lb/>
from twin-sea Corinth, long ago had built<lb/>
a city's walls between unequal ports.<lb/>


    
“Midway between the streams of Cyane<lb/>
and Arethusa lies a moon-like pool,<lb/>
of silvered narrow horns. There stood the Nymph,<lb/>
revered above all others in that land,<lb/>
whose name was Cyane. From her that pond<lb/>
was always called. And as she stood, concealed<lb/>
in middle waves that circled her white thighs,<lb/>
she recognized the God, and said; ‘O thou<lb/>
shalt go no further, Pluto, thou shalt not<lb/>
by force alone become the son-in-law<lb/>
of Ceres. It is better to beseech<lb/>
a mother's aid than drag her child away!<lb/>
And this sustains my word, if I may thus<lb/>
compare great things with small, Anapis loved<lb/>
me also; but he wooed and married me<lb/>
by kind endearments; not by fear, as thou<lb/>
hast terrified this girl.’ So did she speak;<lb/>
and stretching out her arms on either side<lb/>
opposed his way.<lb/>

    
“The son of Saturn blazed<lb/>
with uncontrolled rage; and urged his steeds,<lb/>
and hurled his royal scepter in the pool.<lb/>
Cast with a mighty arm it pierced the deeps.<lb/>
The smitten earth made way to Tartarus;—<lb/>
it opened a wide basin and received<lb/>
the plunging chariot in the midst.—But now<lb/>
the mournful Cyane began to grieve,<lb/>
because from her against her fountain-rights<lb/>
the goddess had been torn. The deepening wound<lb/>
still rankled in her breast, and she dissolved<lb/>
in many tears, and wasted in those waves<lb/>
which lately were submissive to her rule.<lb/>

    
“So you could see her members waste away:<lb/>
her hones begin to bend; her nails get soft;<lb/>
her azure hair, her fingers, legs and feet,<lb/>
and every slender part melt in the pool:<lb/>
so brief the time in which her tender limbs<lb/>
were changed to flowing waves; and after them<lb/>
her back and shoulders, and her sides and breasts<lb/>
dissolved and vanished into rivulets:<lb/>
and while she changed, the water slowly filled<lb/>
her faulty veins instead of living blood—<lb/>
and nothing that a hand could hold remained.<lb/>

    
“Now it befell when Proserpine was lost,<lb/>
her anxious mother sought through every land<lb/>
and every sea in vain. She rested not.<lb/>
Aurora, when she came with ruddy locks,<lb/>
might never know, nor even Hesperus,<lb/>
if she might deign to rest.—She lit two pines<lb/>
from Aetna's flames and held one in each hand,<lb/>
and restless bore them through the frosty glooms:<lb/>
and when serene the day had dimmed the stars<lb/>
she sought her daughter by the rising sun;<lb/>
and when the sun declined she rested not.<lb/>

    
“Wearied with labour she began to thirst,<lb/>
for all this while no streams had cooled her lips;<lb/>
when, as by chance, a cottage thatched with straw<lb/>
gladdened her sight. Thither the goddess went,<lb/>
and, after knocking at the humble door,<lb/>
waited until an ancient woman came;<lb/>
who, when she saw the goddess and had heard<lb/>
her plea for water, gave her a sweet drink,<lb/>
but lately brewed of parched barley-meal;<lb/>
and while the goddess quaffed this drink a boy,<lb/>
of bold and hard appearance, stood before<lb/>
and laughed and called her greedy. While he spoke<lb/>
the angry goddess sprinkled him with meal,<lb/>
mixed with the liquid which had not been drunk.<lb/>

    
“His face grew spotted where the mixture struck,<lb/>
and legs appeared where he had arms before,<lb/>
a tail was added to his changing trunk;<lb/>
and lest his former strength might cause great harm,<lb/>
all parts contracted till he measured less<lb/>
than common lizards. While the ancient dame<lb/>
wondered and wept and strove for one caress,<lb/>
the reptile fled and sought a lurking place.—<lb/>
His very name describes him to the eye,<lb/>
a body starred with many coloured spots.<lb/>

    
“What lands, what oceans Ceres wandered then,<lb/>
would weary to relate. The bounded world<lb/>
was narrow for the search. Again she passed<lb/>
through Sicily; again observed all signs;<lb/>
and as she wandered came to Cyane,<lb/>
who strove to tell where Proserpine had gone,<lb/>
but since her change, had neither mouth nor tongue,<lb/>
and so was mute. And yet the Nymph made plain<lb/>
by certain signs what she desired to say:<lb/>
for on the surface of the waves she showed<lb/>
a well-known girdle Proserpine had lost,<lb/>
by chance had dropped it in that sacred pool;<lb/>
which when the goddess recognized, at last,<lb/>
convinced her daughter had been forced from her,<lb/>
she tore her streaming locks, and frenzied struck<lb/>
her bosom with her palms. And in her rage,<lb/>
although she wist not where her daughter was,<lb/>
she blamed all countries and cried out against<lb/>
their base ingratitude; and she declared<lb/>
the world unworthy of the gift of corn:<lb/>
but Sicily before all other lands,<lb/>
for there was found the token of her loss.<lb/>

    
“For that she broke with savage hand the plows,<lb/>
which there had turned the soil, and full of wrath<lb/>
leveled in equal death the peasant and his ox—<lb/>
both tillers of the soil—and made decree<lb/>
that land should prove deceptive to the seed,<lb/>
and rot all planted germs.—That fertile isle,<lb/>
so noted through the world, becomes a waste;<lb/>
the corn is blighted in the early blade;<lb/>
excessive heat, excessive rain destroys;<lb/>
the winds destroy, the constellations harm;<lb/>
the greedy birds devour the scattered seeds;<lb/>
thistles and tares and tough weeds choke the wheat.<lb/>


    
“For this the Nymph, Alpheian, raised her head<lb/>
above Elean waves; and having first<lb/>
pushed back her dripping tresses from her brows,<lb/>
back to her ears, she thus began to speak;<lb/>
‘O mother of the virgin, sought throughout<lb/>
the globe! O mother of nutritious fruits!<lb/>
Let these tremendous labours have an end;<lb/>
do not increase the violence of thy wrath<lb/>
against the Earth, devoted to thy sway,<lb/>
and not deserving blame; for only force<lb/>
compelled the Earth to open for that wrong.<lb/>
Think not my supplication is to aid<lb/>
my native country; hither I am come<lb/>
an alien: Pisa is my native land,<lb/>
and Elis gave me birth. Though I sojourn<lb/>
a stranger in this isle of Sicily<lb/>
it yet delights me more than all the world.<lb/>

    
‘I, Arethusa, claim this isle my home,<lb/>
and do implore thee keep my throne secure,<lb/>
O greatest of the Gods! A better hour,<lb/>
when thou art lightened of thy cares, will come,<lb/>
and when thy countenance again is kind;<lb/>
and then may I declare what cause removed<lb/>
me from my native place—and through the waves<lb/>
of such a mighty ocean guided me<lb/>
to find Ortygia.<lb/>

    
‘Through the porous earth<lb/>
by deepest caverns, I uplift my head<lb/>
and see unwonted stars. Now it befell,<lb/>
as I was gliding far beneath the world,<lb/>
where flow dark Stygian streams, I saw<lb/>
thy Proserpine. Although her countenance<lb/>
betrayed anxiety and grief, a queen She reigned<lb/>
supremely great in that opacous world<lb/>
queen consort mighty to the King of Hell.’<lb/>

“Astonished and amazed, as thunderstruck,<lb/>
when Proserpina's mother heard these words,<lb/>
long while she stood till great bewilderment<lb/>
gave way to heavy grief. Then to the skies,<lb/>
ethereal, she mounted in her car<lb/>
and with beclouded face and streaming hair<lb/>
stood fronting Jove, opprobrious. ‘I have come<lb/>
O Jupiter, a suppliant to thee,<lb/>
both for my own offspring as well as thine.<lb/>
If thy hard heart deny a mother grace,<lb/>
yet haply as a father thou canst feel<lb/>
some pity for thy daughter; and I pray<lb/>
thy care for her may not be valued less<lb/>
because my groaning travail brought her forth.—<lb/>
My long-sought daughter has at last been found,<lb/>
if one can call it, found, when certain loss<lb/>
more certain has been proved; or so may deem<lb/>
the knowledge of her state.—But I may bear<lb/>
his rude ways, if again he bring her back.<lb/>

    
‘Thy worthy child should not be forced to wed<lb/>
a bandit-chief, nor should my daughter's charms<lb/>
reward his crime.’ She spoke;—and Jupiter<lb/>
took up the word; ‘This daughter is a care,<lb/>
a sacred pledge to me as well as thee;<lb/>
but if it please us to acknowledge truth,<lb/>
this is a deed of love and injures not.<lb/>
And if, O goddess, thou wilt not oppose,<lb/>
such law-son cannot compass our disgrace:<lb/>
for though all else were wanting, naught can need<lb/>
Jove's brother, who in fortune yields to none<lb/>
save me. But if thy fixed desire compel<lb/>
dissent, let Proserpine return to Heaven;<lb/>
however, subject to the binding law,<lb/>
if there her tongue have never tasted food—<lb/>
a sure condition, by the Fates decreed.’<lb/>
he spoke; but Ceres was no less resolved<lb/>
to lead her daughter thence.<lb/>

    
“Not so the Fates<lb/>
permit.—The virgin, thoughtless while she strayed<lb/>
among the cultivated Stygian fields,<lb/>
had broken fast. While there she plucked the fruit<lb/>
by bending a pomegranate tree, and plucked,<lb/>
and chewed seven grains, picked from the pallid rind;<lb/>
and none had seen except Ascalaphus—<lb/>
him Orphne, famed of all Avernian Nymphs,<lb/>
had brought to birth in some infernal cave,<lb/>
days long ago, from Acheron's embrace—<lb/>
he saw it, and with cruel lips debarred<lb/>
young Proserpine's return. Heaving a sigh,<lb/>
the Queen of Erebus, indignant changed<lb/>
that witness to an evil bird: she turned<lb/>
his head, with sprinkled Phlegethonian lymph,<lb/>
into a beak, and feathers, and great eyes;<lb/>
his head grew larger and his shape, deformed,<lb/>
was cased in tawny wings; his lengthened nails<lb/>
bent inward;—and his sluggish arms<lb/>
as wings can hardly move. So he became<lb/>
the vilest bird; a messenger of grief;<lb/>
the lazy owl; sad omen to mankind.<lb/>

    
“The telltale's punishment was only just;<lb/>
O Siren Maids, but wherefore thus have ye<lb/>
the feet and plumes of birds, although remain<lb/>
your virgin features? Is it from the day<lb/>
when Proserpina gathered vernal flowers;<lb/>
because ye mingled with her chosen friends?<lb/>
And after she was lost, in vain ye sought<lb/>
through all the world; and wished for wings to waft<lb/>
you over the great deep, that soon the sea<lb/>
might feel your great concern.—The Gods were kind:<lb/>
ye saw your limbs grow yellow, with a growth<lb/>
of sudden-sprouting feathers; but because<lb/>
your melodies that gently charm the ear,<lb/>
besides the glory of your speech, might lose<lb/>
the blessing, of a tongue, your virgin face<lb/>
and human voice remained.<lb/>

    
“But Jupiter,<lb/>
the mediator of these rival claims,<lb/>
urged by his brother and his grieving sister,<lb/>
divided the long year in equal parts.<lb/>
Now Proserpina, as a Deity,<lb/>
of equal merit, in two kingdoms reigns:—<lb/>
for six months with her mother she abides,<lb/>
and six months with her husband.—Both her mind<lb/>
and her appearance quickly were transformed;<lb/>
for she who seemed so sad in Pluto's eyes,<lb/>
now as a goddess beams in joyful smiles;<lb/>
so, when the sun obscured by watery mist<lb/>
conquers the clouds, it shines in splendour forth.<lb/>


Arethusa.
CALLIOPE SINGS OF ARETHUSA AND ALPHEUS

“And genial Ceres, full of joy, that now<lb/>
her daughter was regained, began to speak;<lb/>
‘Declare the reason of thy wanderings,<lb/>
O Arethusa! tell me wherefore thou<lb/>
wert made a sacred stream.’ The waters gave<lb/>
no sound; but soon that goddess raised her head<lb/>
from the deep springs; and after sue had dried<lb/>
her green hair with her hand, with fair address<lb/>
she told the ancient amours of that stream<lb/>
which flows through Elis.—‘I was one among<lb/>
the Nymphs of old Achaia,’—so she said—<lb/>
‘And none of them more eager sped than I,<lb/>
along the tangled pathways; and I fixed<lb/>
the hunting-nets with zealous care.—Although<lb/>
I strove not for the praise that beauty gives,<lb/>
and though my form was something stout for grace,<lb/>
it had the name of being beautiful.<lb/>

    
‘So worthless seemed the praise, I took no joy<lb/>
in my appearance—as a country lass<lb/>
I blushed at those endowments which would give<lb/>
delight to others—even the power to please<lb/>
seemed criminal.—And I remember when<lb/>
returning weary from Stymphal fan woods,<lb/>
and hot with toil, that made the glowing sun<lb/>
seem twice as hot, I chanced upon a stream,<lb/>
that flowed without a ripple or a sound<lb/>
so smoothly on, I hardly thought it moved.<lb/>

    
‘The water was so clear that one could see<lb/>
and count the pebbles in the deepest parts,<lb/>
and silver willows and tall poplar trees,<lb/>
nourished by flowing waters, spread their shade<lb/>
over the shelving banks. So I approached,<lb/>
and shrinkingly touched the cool stream with my feet;<lb/>
and then I ventured deeper to my knees;<lb/>
and not contented doffed my fleecy robes,<lb/>
and laid them on a bending willow tree.<lb/>
Then, naked, I plunged deeply in the stream,<lb/>
and while I smote the water with my hands,<lb/>
and drew it towards me, striking boldly forth,<lb/>
moving my body in a thousand ways,<lb/>
I thought I heard a most unusual sound,<lb/>
a murmuring noise beneath the middle stream.<lb/>

    
‘Alarmed, I hastened to the nearest bank,<lb/>
and as I stood upon its edge, these words<lb/>
hoarsely Alpheus uttered from his waves;<lb/>
‘Oh, whither dost thou hasten?’ and again,<lb/>
‘Oh, whither dost thou hasten?’ said the voice.<lb/>

    
‘Just as I was, I fled without my clothes,<lb/>
for I had left them on the other bank;<lb/>
which, when he saw, so much the more inflamed,<lb/>
more swiftly he pursued: my nakedness<lb/>
was tempting to his gaze. And thus I ran;<lb/>
and thus relentlessly he pressed my steps:<lb/>
so from the hawk the dove with trembling wings;<lb/>
and so, the hawk pursues the frightened dove.<lb/>

    
‘Swiftly and long I fled, with winding course,<lb/>
to Orchamenus, Psophis and Cyllene,<lb/>
and Maenalus and Erymanthus cold,<lb/>
and Elis. Neither could he gain by speed,<lb/>
although his greater strength must soon prevail,<lb/>
for I not longer could endure the strain.<lb/>

    
‘Still I sped onward through the fields and woods,<lb/>
by tangled wilds and over rocks and crags;<lb/>
and as I hastened from the setting sun,<lb/>
I thought I saw a growing shadow move<lb/>
beyond my feet; it may have been my fear<lb/>
imagined it, but surely now I heard<lb/>
the sound of footsteps: I could even feel<lb/>
his breathing on the loose ends of my hair;<lb/>
and I was terrified. At last, worn out<lb/>
by all my efforts to escape, I cried;<lb/>
‘Oh, help me—thou whose bow and quivered darts<lb/>
I oft have borne—thy armour-bearer calls—<lb/>
O chaste Diana help,—or I am lost.’<lb/>

‘It moved the goddess, and she gathered up<lb/>
a dense cloud, and encompassed me about.—<lb/>
The baffled River circled round and round,<lb/>
seeking to find me, hidden in that cloud—<lb/>
twice went the River round, and twice cried out,<lb/>
‘Ho, Arethusa! Arethusa, Ho!’<lb/>

‘What were my wretched feelings then? Could I<lb/>
be braver than the Iamb that hears the wolves,<lb/>
howling around the high-protecting fold?<lb/>
Or than the hare, which lurking in the bush<lb/>
knows of the snarling hounds and dares not move?<lb/>
And yet, Alpheus thence would not depart,<lb/>
for he could find no footprints of my flight.<lb/>

    
‘He watched the cloud and spot, and thus besieged,<lb/>
a cold sweat gathered on my trembling limbs.<lb/>
The clear-blue drops, distilled from every pore,<lb/>
made pools of water where I moved my feet,<lb/>
and dripping moisture trickled from my hair.—<lb/>
Much quicker than my story could be told,<lb/>
my body was dissolved to flowing streams.—<lb/>
But still the River recognized the waves,<lb/>
and for the love of me transformed his shape<lb/>
from human features to his proper streams,<lb/>
that so his waters might encompass mine.<lb/>

    
‘Diana, therefore, opened up the ground,<lb/>
in which I plunged, and thence through gloomy caves<lb/>
was carried to Ortygia—blessed isle!<lb/>
To which my chosen goddess gave her name!<lb/>
Where first I rose amid the upper air!’<lb/>

CALLIOPE SINGS OF TRIPTOLEMUS AND LYNCUS

“Thus Arethusa made an end of speech:<lb/>
and presently the fertile goddess yoked<lb/>
two dragons to her chariot: she curbed<lb/>
their mouths with bits: they bore her through the air,<lb/>
in her light car betwixt the earth and skies,<lb/>
to the Tritonian citadel, and to<lb/>
Triptolemus, to whom she furnished seed,<lb/>
that he might scatter it in wasted lands,<lb/>
and in the fallow fields; which, after long<lb/>
neglect, again were given to the plow.<lb/>

    
“After he had traveled through uncharted skies,<lb/>
over wide Europe and vast Asian lands,<lb/>
he lit upon the coast of Scythia, where<lb/>
a king called Lyncus reigned. And there, at once<lb/>
he sought the palace of that king, who said;<lb/>
‘Whence come you, stranger, wherefore in this land?<lb/>
Come, tell to me your nation and your name.’<lb/>

“And after he was questioned thus, he said,<lb/>
‘I came from far-famed Athens and they call<lb/>
my name Triptolemus. I neither came<lb/>
by ship through waves, nor over the dry land;<lb/>
for me the yielding atmosphere makes way.—<lb/>
I bear the gifts of Ceres to your land,<lb/>
which scattered over your wide realm may yield<lb/>
an ample harvest of nutritious food.’<lb/>

“The envious Lyncus, wishing to appear<lb/>
the gracious author of all benefits,<lb/>
received the unsuspecting youth with smiles;<lb/>
but when he fell into a heavy sleep<lb/>
that savage king attacked him with a sword—<lb/>
but while attempting to transfix his guest,<lb/>
the goddess Ceres changed him to a lynx:—<lb/>
and once again she sent her favoured youth<lb/>
to drive her sacred dragons through the clouds.<lb/>

THE NINE OPPONENTS OF THE NINE MUSES CHANGED TO MAGPIES

“The greatest of our number ended thus<lb/>
her learned songs; and with concordant voice<lb/>
the chosen Nymphs adjudged the Deities,<lb/>
on Helicon who dwell, should be proclaimed<lb/>
the victors.<lb/>

    
“But the vanquished nine began<lb/>
to scatter their abuse; to whom rejoined<lb/>
the goddess; ‘Since it seems a trifling thing<lb/>
that you should suffer a deserved defeat,<lb/>
and you must add unmerited abuse<lb/>
to heighten your offence, and since by this<lb/>
appears the end of our endurance, we<lb/>
shall certainly proceed to punish you<lb/>
according to the limit of our wrath.’<lb/>

    
“But these Emathian sisters laughed to scorn<lb/>
our threatening words; and as they tried to speak,<lb/>
and made great clamour, and with shameless hands<lb/>
made threatening gestures, suddenly stiff quills<lb/>
sprouted from out their finger-nails, and plumes<lb/>
spread over their stretched arms; and they could see<lb/>
the mouth of each companion growing out<lb/>
into a rigid beak.—And thus new birds<lb/>
were added to the forest.—While they made<lb/>
complaint, these Magpies that defile our groves,<lb/>
moving their stretched-out arms, began to float,<lb/>
suspended in the air. And since that time<lb/>
their ancient eloquence, their screaming notes,<lb/>
their tiresome zeal of speech have all remained.”<lb/>

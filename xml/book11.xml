Orphei mors.
DEATH OF ORPHEUS

While with his songs, Orpheus, the bard of Thrace,<lb/>
allured the trees, the savage animals,<lb/>
and even the insensate rocks, to follow him;<lb/>
Ciconian matrons, with their raving breasts<lb/>
concealed in skins of forest animals,<lb/>
from the summit of a hill observed him there,<lb/>
attuning love songs to a sounding harp.<lb/>
One of those women, as her tangled hair<lb/>
was tossed upon the light breeze shouted, “See!<lb/>
Here is the poet who has scorned our love!”<lb/>
Then hurled her spear at the melodious mouth<lb/>
of great Apollo's bard: but the spear's point,<lb/>
trailing in flight a garland of fresh leaves,<lb/>
made but a harmless bruise and wounded not.<lb/>

    
The weapon of another was a stone,<lb/>
which in the very air was overpowered<lb/>
by the true harmony of his voice and lyre,<lb/>
and so disabled lay before his feet,<lb/>
as asking pardon for that vain attempt.<lb/>

    
The madness of such warfare then increased.<lb/>
All moderation is entirely lost, <lb/>
and a wild Fury overcomes the right.—<lb/>
although their weapons would have lost all force,<lb/>
subjected to the power of Orpheus' harp,<lb/>
the clamorous discord of their boxwood pipes,<lb/>
the blaring of their horns, their tambourines<lb/>
and clapping hands and Bacchanalian yells,<lb/>
with hideous discords drowned his voice and harp.—<lb/>
at last the stones that heard his song no more<lb/>
fell crimson with the Thracian poet's blood.<lb/>

    
Before his life was taken, the maenads turned<lb/>
their threatening hands upon the many birds,<lb/>
which still were charmed by Orpheus as he sang,<lb/>
the serpents, and the company of beasts—<lb/>
fabulous audience of that worshipped bard.<lb/>
And then they turned on him their blood-stained hands:<lb/>
and flocked together swiftly, as wild birds,<lb/>
which, by some chance, may see the bird of night<lb/>
beneath the sun. And as the savage dogs<lb/>
rush on the doomed stag, loosed some bright fore-noon,<lb/>
on blood-sand of the amphitheatre;<lb/>
they rushed against the bard, with swift<lb/>
hurled thyrsi which, adorned with emerald leaves<lb/>
had not till then been used for cruelty.<lb/>

    
And some threw clods, and others branches torn<lb/>
from trees; and others threw flint stones at him,<lb/>
and, that no lack of weapons might restrain<lb/>
their savage fury then, not far from there<lb/>
by chance they found some oxen which turned up<lb/>
the soil with ploughshares, and in fields nearby<lb/>
were strong-armed peasants, who with eager sweat<lb/>
worked for the harvest as they dug hard fields;<lb/>
and all those peasants, when they saw the troop<lb/>
of frantic women, ran away and left<lb/>
their implements of labor strown upon<lb/>
deserted fields—harrows and heavy rakes<lb/>
and their long spades<lb/>

    
after the savage mob<lb/>
had seized upon those implements, and torn<lb/>
to pieces oxen armed with threatening horns,<lb/>
they hastened to destroy the harmless bard,<lb/>
devoted Orpheus; and with impious hate,<lb/>
murdered him, while his out-stretched hands implored<lb/>
their mercy—the first and only time his voice<lb/>
had no persuasion. O great Jupiter!<lb/>
Through those same lips which had controlled the rocks<lb/>
and which had overcome ferocious beasts,<lb/>
his life breathed forth, departed in the air.<lb/>

    
The mournful birds, the stricken animals,<lb/>
the hard stones and the weeping woods, all these<lb/>
that often had followed your inspiring voice,<lb/>
bewailed your death; while trees dropped their green leaves,<lb/>
mourning for you, as if they tore their hair.<lb/>
They say sad rivers swelled with their own tears—<lb/>
naiads and dryads with dishevelled hair<lb/>
wore garments of dark color.<lb/>

    
His torn limbs<lb/>
were scattered in strange places. Hebrus then<lb/>
received his head and harp—and, wonderful!<lb/>
While his loved harp was floating down the stream,<lb/>
it mourned for him beyond my power to tell.<lb/>
His tongue though lifeless, uttered a mournful sound<lb/>
and mournfully the river's banks replied:<lb/>
onward borne by the river to the sea<lb/>
they left their native stream and reached the shore<lb/>
of Lesbos at Methymna. Instantly,<lb/>
a furious serpent rose to attack the head<lb/>
of Orpheus, cast up on that foreign sand—<lb/>
the hair still wet with spray. Phoebus at last<lb/>
appeared and saved the head from that attack:<lb/>
before the serpent could inflict a sting,<lb/>
he drove it off, and hardened its wide jaws<lb/>
to rigid stone.<lb/>

    
Meanwhile the fleeting shade<lb/>
of Orpheus had descended under earth:<lb/>
remembering now those regions that he saw<lb/>
when there before, he sought Eurydice<lb/>
through fields frequented by the blest; and when<lb/>
he found her, folded her in eager arms.<lb/>
Then lovingly they wandered side by side,<lb/>
or he would follow when she chose to lead,<lb/>
or at another time he walked in front,<lb/>
looking back, safely,—at Eurydice.<lb/>

    
Bacchus would not permit the wickedness<lb/>
of those who slaughtered Orpheus to remain<lb/>
unpunished. Grieving for the loss of his<lb/>
loved bard of sacred rites, at once he bound<lb/>
with twisted roots the feet of everyone<lb/>
of those Edonian women who had caused<lb/>
the crime of Orpheus' death.<lb/>

    
Their toes grew long.<lb/>
He thrust the sharp points in the solid earth.<lb/>
As when a bird entangled in a snare,<lb/>
hid by the cunning fowler, knows too late<lb/>
that it is held, then vainly beats its wings,<lb/>
and fluttering only makes more tight the noose<lb/>
with every struggle; so each woman-fiend<lb/>
whose feet were sinking in the soil, when she<lb/>
attempted flight, was held by deepening roots.<lb/>
And while she looks down where her toes and nails<lb/>
and feet should be, she sees wood growing up<lb/>
from them and covering all her graceful legs.<lb/>
Full of delirious grief, endeavoring<lb/>
to smite with right hand on her changing thigh,<lb/>
she strikes on solid oak. Her tender breast<lb/>
and shoulders are transformed to rigid oak.<lb/>
You would declare that her extended arms<lb/>
are real branches of a forest tree,<lb/>
and such a thought would be the very truth.<lb/>


Midas aureus.
BACCHUS AND MIDAS

And not content with this, Bacchus resolved<lb/>
to leave that land, and with a worthier train<lb/>
went to the vineyards of his own Tmolus<lb/>
and to Pactolus, though the river was<lb/>
not golden, nor admired for precious sands.<lb/>
His usual throng of Satyrs and of Bacchanals<lb/>
surrounded him; but not Silenus, who<lb/>
was then detained from him. The Phrygian folk<lb/>
had captured him, as he was staggering, faint<lb/>
with palsied age and wine. And after they<lb/>
bound him in garlands, they led him to their king<lb/>
Midas, to whom with the Cecropian<lb/>
Eumolpus, Thracian Orpheus had shown all<lb/>
the Bacchic rites. When Midas recognized<lb/>
his old time friend Silenus, who had been<lb/>
so often his companion in the rites<lb/>
of Bacchus, he kept joyful festival,<lb/>
with his old comrade, twice five days and nights.<lb/>

    
Upon the eleventh day, when Lucifer<lb/>
had dimmed the lofty multitude of stars,<lb/>
King Midas and Silenus went from there<lb/>
joyful together to the Lydian lands.<lb/>
There Midas put Silenus carefully<lb/>
under the care of his loved foster-child,<lb/>
young Bacchus. He with great delight, because<lb/>
he had his foster-father once again,<lb/>
allowed the king to choose his own reward—<lb/>
a welcome offer, but it led to harm.<lb/>
And Midas made this ill-advised reply:<lb/>
“Cause whatsoever I shall touch to change<lb/>
at once to yellow gold.” Bacchus agreed<lb/>
to his unfortunate request, with grief 	<lb/>
that Midas chose for harm and not for good.<lb/>
The Berecynthian hero, king of Phrygia,<lb/>
with joy at his misfortune went away,<lb/>
and instantly began to test the worth<lb/>
of Bacchus' word by touching everything.<lb/>

    
Doubtful himself of his new power, he pulled<lb/>
a twig down from a holm-oak, growing on<lb/>
a low hung branch. The twig was turned to gold.<lb/>
He lifted up a dark stone from the ground<lb/>
and it turned pale with gold. He touched a clod<lb/>
and by his potent touch the clod became<lb/>
a mass of shining gold. He plucked some ripe,<lb/>
dry spears of grain, and all that wheat he touched<lb/>
was golden. Then he held an apple which<lb/>
he gathered from a tree, and you would think<lb/>
that the Hesperides had given it.<lb/>
If he but touched a lofty door, at once<lb/>
each door-post seemed to glisten. When he washed<lb/>
his hands in liquid streams, the lustrous drops<lb/>
upon his hands might have been those which once<lb/>
astonished Danae. He could not now<lb/>
conceive his large hopes in his grasping mind,<lb/>
as he imagined everything of gold.<lb/>

    
And, while he was rejoicing in great wealth,<lb/>
his servants set a table for his meal,<lb/>
with many dainties and with needful bread:<lb/>
but when he touched the gift of Ceres with<lb/>
his right hand, instantly the gift of Ceres<lb/>
stiffened to gold; or if he tried to bite<lb/>
with hungry teeth a tender bit of meat,<lb/>
the dainty, as his teeth but touched it, shone<lb/>
at once with yellow shreds and flakes of gold.<lb/>
And wine, another gift of Bacchus, when<lb/>
he mixed it in pure water, can be seen<lb/>
in his astonished mouth as liquid gold.<lb/>

    
Confounded by his strange misfortune—rich<lb/>
and wretched—he was anxious to escape<lb/>
from his unhappy wealth. He hated all<lb/>
he had so lately longed for. Plenty could<lb/>
not lessen hunger and no remedy<lb/>
relieved his dry, parched throat. The hated gold<lb/>
tormented him no more than he deserved.<lb/>
Lifting his hands and shining arms to heaven,<lb/>
he moaned. “Oh pardon me, father Lenaeus!<lb/>
I have done wrong, but pity me, I pray,<lb/>
and save me from this curse that looked so fair.”<lb/>

    
How patient are the gods! Bacchus forthwith,<lb/>
because King Midas had confessed his fault,<lb/>
restored him and annulled the promise given,<lb/>
annulled the favor granted, and he said:<lb/>

    
“That you may not be always cased in gold,<lb/>
which you unhappily desired, depart<lb/>
to the stream that flows by that great town of Sardis<lb/>
and upward trace its waters, as they glide<lb/>
past Lydian heights, until you find their source.<lb/>
Then, where the spring leaps out from mountain rock,<lb/>
plunge head and body in the snowy foam.<lb/>
At once the flood will take away your curse.”<lb/>

    
King Midas did as he was told and plunged<lb/>
beneath the water at the river's source.<lb/>
And the gold virtue granted by the god,<lb/>
as it departed from his body, tinged<lb/>
the stream with gold. And even to this hour<lb/>
adjoining fields, touched by this ancient vein<lb/>
of gold, are hardened where the river flows<lb/>
and colored with the gold that Midas left.<lb/>


Midae aures.
THE MUSICAL CONTEST OF PAN AND APOLLO

Abhorring riches he inhabited<lb/>
the woods and fields, and followed Pan who dwells<lb/>
always in mountain-caves: but still obtuse<lb/>
remained, from which his foolish mind again,<lb/>
by an absurd decision, harmed his life.<lb/>
He followed Pan up to the lofty mount<lb/>
Tmolus, which from its great height looks far<lb/>
across the sea. Steep and erect it stands<lb/>
between great Sardis and the small Hypaepa.<lb/>

    
While Pan was boasting there to mountain nymphs<lb/>
of his great skill in music, and while he<lb/>
was warbling a gay tune upon the reeds,<lb/>
cemented with soft wax, in his conceit<lb/>
he dared to boast to them how he despised<lb/>
Apollo's music when compared with his—.<lb/>
At last to prove it, he agreed to stand<lb/>
against Apollo in a contest which<lb/>
it was agreed should be decided by<lb/>
Tmolus as their umpire.<lb/>

    
This old god<lb/>
sat down on his own mountain, and first eased<lb/>
his ears of many mountain growing trees,<lb/>
oak leaves were wreathed upon his azure hair<lb/>
and acorns from his hollow temples hung.<lb/>
First to the Shepherd-god Tmolus spoke:<lb/>

    
“My judgment shall be yours with no delay.<lb/>
Pan made some rustic sounds on his rough reeds,<lb/>
delighting Midas with his uncouth notes;<lb/>
for Midas chanced to be there when he played.<lb/>

    
When Pan had ceased, divine Tmolus turned<lb/>
to Phoebus, and the forest likewise turned<lb/>
just as he moved. Apollo's golden locks<lb/>
were richly wreathed with fresh Parnassian laurel;<lb/>
his robe of Tyrian purple swept the ground;<lb/>
his left hand held his lyre, adorned with gems<lb/>
and Indian ivory. His right hand held<lb/>
the plectrum—as an artist he stood there<lb/>
before Tmolus, while his skilful thumb<lb/>
touching the strings made charming melody.<lb/>

    
Delighted with Apollo's artful touch,<lb/>
Tmolus ordered Pan to hold his reeds<lb/>
excelled by beauty of Apollo's lyre.<lb/>
That judgment of the sacred mountain god<lb/>
pleased all those present, all but Midas, who<lb/>
blaming Tmolus called the award unjust.<lb/>

    
The Delian god forbids his stupid ears<lb/>
to hold their native human shape;<lb/>
and, drawing them out to a hideous length,<lb/>
he fills them with gray hairs, and makes them both<lb/>
unsteady, wagging at the lower part:<lb/>
still human, only this one part condemned,<lb/>
Midas had ears of a slow-moving ass.<lb/>

    
Midas, careful to hide his long ears, wore<lb/>
a purple turban over both, which hid<lb/>
his foul disgrace from laughter. But one day<lb/>
a servant, who was chosen to cut his hair<lb/>
with steel, when it was long, saw his disgrace.<lb/>
He did not dare reveal what he had seen,<lb/>
but eager, to disclose the secret, dug<lb/>
a shallow hole, and in a low voice told<lb/>
what kind of ears were on his master's head.<lb/>
All this he whispered in the hollow earth<lb/>
he dug, and then he buried all he said<lb/>
by throwing back the loose earth in the hole<lb/>
so everything was silent when he left.<lb/>

    
A grove thick set with quivering reeds<lb/>
began to grow there, and when it matured,<lb/>
about twelve months after that servant left,<lb/>
the grove betrayed its planter. For, moved by<lb/>
a gentle South Wind, it repeated all<lb/>
the words which he had whispered, and disclosed<lb/>
from earth the secret of his master's ears.<lb/>


Laomedon. Hesione.
HESIONE

His vengence now complete, Latona's son<lb/>
borne through the liquid air, departed from<lb/>
Tmolus, and then rested on the land<lb/>
of Laomedon, this side the narrow sea<lb/>
dividing Phrygia from the land of Thrace.<lb/>
The promontory of Sigaeum right<lb/>
and on the left Rhoetaeum loftily arose;<lb/>
and at that place an ancient altar had<lb/>
been dedicated to great Jove, the god<lb/>
Panomphaean. And near that place he saw<lb/>
laomedon, beginning then to build<lb/>
the walls of famous Troy. He was convinced<lb/>
the task exceeded all the power of man,<lb/>
requiring great resource. Together with<lb/>
the trident-bearing father of the deep,<lb/>
he assumed a mortal form: and those two gods<lb/>
agreed to labor for a sum of gold<lb/>
and built the mighty wall. But that false king<lb/>
refused all payment, adding perjury<lb/>
to his false bargaining. Neptune, enraged,<lb/>
said, “You shall not escape your punishment.”<lb/>
And he drove all his waters high upon<lb/>
the shores of Troy—built there through perfidy.<lb/>

    
The sad land seemed a sea: the hard-earned wealth<lb/>
of all its farmers was destroyed<lb/>
and overwhelmed by furious waves.<lb/>
This awful punishment was not enough.<lb/>
The daughter of the king was soon required<lb/>
as food for a sea-monster—. Hesione<lb/>
was chained to rugged rocks. But Hercules<lb/>
delivered from all harm the royal maid<lb/>
and justly he demanded of the king,<lb/>
her father, payment of the promised steeds;<lb/>
but that perfidious king refused to keep<lb/>
his promise. Hercules enraged, because<lb/>
all payment was denied to him for his<lb/>
great service, captured the twice-perjured walls<lb/>
of conquered Troy. And as a fair reward,<lb/>
he gave to Telamon, who fought for him,<lb/>
Hesione, loved daughter of that king.<lb/>
For Peleus had a goddess as his bride<lb/>
and he was prouder of his father-in-law<lb/>
than of his grandsire. Since not he alone<lb/>
was grandson of great Jove, but he alone<lb/>
was honored with a goddess for a wife.<lb/>


Peleus et Thetis.
PELEUS AND THETIS. BIRTH OF ACHILLES.

To Thetis, aged Proteus once had said,<lb/>
“Oh goddess of the waves, you shall conceive,<lb/>
and you shall be the mother of a youth<lb/>
who by heroic actions will surpass<lb/>
the deeds of his own father, and your son<lb/>
shall be superior to his father's power.”<lb/>
So Jupiter, although the flame of love<lb/>
for Thetis burned his breast, would not embrace<lb/>
the lovely daughter of the sea, and urged<lb/>
his grandson Peleus, son of Aeacus,<lb/>
to wed the green haired maid without delay.<lb/>

    
There is a curved bay of Haemonia,<lb/>
where like an arch, two bending arms<lb/>
project out in the waves, as if to form<lb/>
a harbor; but the water is not deep—<lb/>
although enough to hide a shoal of sand.<lb/>
It has a firm shore which will not retain<lb/>
a foot's impression, nor delay the step—<lb/>
no seaweeds grow in that vicinity.<lb/>

    
There is a grove of myrtle near that place<lb/>
thick-hung with berries, blended of twin shades.<lb/>
A cave within the middle of that grove<lb/>
is found, and whether it was formed by art<lb/>
or nature is not known, although it seems<lb/>
a work of art. There Thetis often went,<lb/>
quite naked, seated on her dolphin, which<lb/>
was harnessed. Peleus seized her there when she<lb/>
was fast asleep: and after he had tried<lb/>
to win her by entreaties, while she long<lb/>
continued to resist him, he resolved<lb/>
to conquer her by violence, and seized<lb/>
her neck with both arms. She resorted then<lb/>
to all her usual art, and often changed:	<lb/>
her shape as it was known, so that he failed<lb/>
in his attempt. At first she was a bird,<lb/>
but while she seemed a bird he held her fast;<lb/>
and then she changed herself to a large tree,<lb/>
and Peleus clung with ardor to the tree;<lb/>
her third disguise was as a spotted tigress,<lb/>
which frightened him so that he lost his hold.<lb/>

    
Then, as he poured wine on the heaving sea,<lb/>
he prayed unto the sea green gods and gave<lb/>
them sacrifice of sheep entrails, and smoke<lb/>
of frankincense. He ceased not, till at last<lb/>
the prophet of Carpathia, as he rose<lb/>
up from a deep wave, said, “Hark unto me,<lb/>
O son of Aeacus! and you shall have<lb/>
the bride your heart desires: when she at rest<lb/>
lies sleeping in the cool wave, you must bind<lb/>
her while she is unwary, with strong cords<lb/>
and complicated bonds, And never let<lb/>
her arts deceive you when she imitates<lb/>
a hundred varied forms, but hold her fast,<lb/>
whatever she may seem, until she shall<lb/>
at length assume the shape she had at first.”<lb/>
So Proteus cautioned him, and hid his face<lb/>
beneath the waves as his last words were said.<lb/>

    
Now Titan was descending and the pole<lb/>
of his bright chariot as it downward bent<lb/>
illuminated the Hesperian main;<lb/>
and at that time the lovely Nereid,<lb/>
Thetis, departing from her ocean wave,<lb/>
entered the cavern for desired repose.<lb/>

    
Peleus was waiting there. Immediately,<lb/>
just as he seized upon the virgin's limbs,<lb/>
she changed her shape and perservered<lb/>
until convinced she could not overcome <lb/>
his hold—for her two arms were forced apart—<lb/>
she groaned and said, “You could not overcome<lb/>
me in this way, but some divinity<lb/>
has given you the power.” Then she appeared<lb/>
as Thetis: and, when Peleus saw her now<lb/>
deprived of all deceptions, he embraced<lb/>
her and was father of the great Achilles.<lb/>


Peleus apud Ceycem.
DAEDALION CHANGED TO A HAWK	

Great Peleus' heart was filled with happiness;<lb/>
because of his great son and Thetis his<lb/>
dear wife: he was blest in everything, except<lb/>
in killing Phocus. The Trachinian land<lb/>
received him guilty of his brother's blood;<lb/>
when he fled, banished from his native home.<lb/>
There Ceyx, who had the fine countenance<lb/>
of Lucifer his father, reigned as king,<lb/>
without the cost of violence or blood.<lb/>
Before this time his days had always given<lb/>
him joy and comfort, but all now was changed,<lb/>
for he was mourning a loved brother's death.<lb/>

    
Peleus, outwearied with his journey's length.<lb/>
Left his fine flock of sheep and all the herds<lb/>
he had brought with him, not far from the walls<lb/>
of that city, where Ceyx long had reigned.<lb/>
He entered with an olive branch all swathed<lb/>
in woolen fillets, symbol of good will,<lb/>
and with a suppliant hand disclosed his name.<lb/>
He told the monarch who he was, also<lb/>
his father's name. But he concealed his crime,<lb/>
giving untruthful reasons for his flight:<lb/>
and begged a refuge either in town or field.<lb/>

    
The king of Trachyn answered with kind words:<lb/>
“Ah, Peleus, even the lowest ranks enjoy<lb/>
our bounties and our hospitality,<lb/>
and you bring with you powers which compell<lb/>
attention and respect. Your name is so<lb/>
illustrious, and is not Jupiter<lb/>
your grandsire? Do not lose your time by such<lb/>
entreaties. Everything you may desire<lb/>
is yours as soon as known, and all you see<lb/>
is partly yours, but in how sad a state!”<lb/>

    
And then he wept. When Peleus and his friends<lb/>
asked him the reason of his grief he said,<lb/>
“Perchance you deem that bird which lives on prey,<lb/>
which is the terror of all other birds,<lb/>
had always feathered wings? It was a man.<lb/>
And now the vigor of its courage is<lb/>
as great as when well known by his man's name,<lb/>
Daedalion, bold in wars and strong and harsh,<lb/>
and not afraid to hazard violence.<lb/>
His father was unequalled Lucifer,<lb/>
star of the Morning, who at dawn brings forth<lb/>
Aurora, and withdraws the last of all<lb/>
the shining stars of heaven.—My brother named<lb/>
daedalion, son of that great star, was fond<lb/>
of cruel warfare, while I cherished peace<lb/>
and loved the quiet of my married life.<lb/>
This brother, powerful in the art of war,<lb/>
subdued strong kings and nations.—And 'tis he<lb/>
transformed from manhood, now a bird of prey,<lb/>
that so relentlessly pursues the doves,<lb/>
known as the pride of Thisbe's citizens.<lb/>

    
“My brother had a daughter Chione<lb/>
so beautiful she pleased a thousand men,<lb/>
when she had reached the marriageable age<lb/>
of twice seven years. It happened by some chance<lb/>
that Phoebus and the son of Maia, who<lb/>
returned—one from his Delphi, the other from<lb/>
Cyllene's heights—beheld this lovely maid<lb/>
both at the same time, and were both inflamed<lb/>
with passion. Phoebus waited till the night.<lb/>

    
Hermes could not endure delay and with<lb/>
the magic of his wand, that causes sleep,<lb/>
he touched the virgin's face; and instantly,<lb/>
as if entranced, she lay there fast asleep,<lb/>
and suffered violence from the ardent god.<lb/>
When night bespangled the wide heaven with stars,<lb/>
Phoebus became an aged crone and gained<lb/>
the joy he had deferred until that hour.<lb/>

    
“When her mature womb had completed time<lb/>
Autolycus was born, a crafty son,<lb/>
who certainly inherited the skill<lb/>
of wingfoot Mereury, his artful sire,<lb/>
notorious now; for every kind of theft.<lb/>
In fact, Autolycus with Mercury's craft,<lb/>
loved to make white of black, and black of white.<lb/>

    
“But Phoebus' child, for Chione bore twins, <lb/>
was named Philammon, like his sire, well known.<lb/>
To all men for the beauty of his song.<lb/>
And famous for his handling of the lyre.<lb/>

    
“What benefit in life did she obtain<lb/>
because she pleased! two gods and bore such twins?<lb/>
Was she blest by good fortune then because <lb/>
she was the daughter of a valiant father,<lb/>
and even the grandchild of the Morning Star?<lb/>
Can glory be a curse? Often it is.<lb/>

    
“And surely it was so for Chione.<lb/>
It was a prejudice that harmed her days<lb/>
because she vaunted that she did surpass<lb/>
Diana's beauty and decried her charms:<lb/>
the goddess in hot anger answered her,<lb/>
sarcastically, ‘If my face cannot<lb/>
give satisfaction, let me try my deeds.’ <lb/>

    
“Without delay Diana bent her bow,<lb/>
and from the string an arrow swiftly flew, <lb/>
and pierced the vaunting tongue of Chione.<lb/>
Her tongue was silenced, and she tried in vain<lb/>
to speak or make a sound, and while she tried<lb/>
her life departed with the flowing blood.<lb/>

    
“Embracing her, I shared her father's grief.<lb/>
I spoke consoling words to my dear brother,<lb/>
he heard them as a cliff might hear the sea.<lb/>
And he lamented bitterly the loss<lb/>
of his dear daughter, snatched away from him.<lb/>

    
“Ah! when he saw her burning, he was filled<lb/>
with such an uncontrolled despair, he rushed<lb/>
four times to leap upon the blazing pyre;<lb/>
and after he had been four times repulsed,<lb/>
he turned and rushed away in headlong flight<lb/>
through trackless country, as a bullock flees,<lb/>
his swollen neck pierced with sharp hornet-stings,<lb/>
it seemed to me he ran beyond the speed<lb/>
of any human being. You would think<lb/>
his feet had taken wings, he left us far<lb/>
behind and swift in his desire for death<lb/>
he stood at last upon Parnassus' height.<lb/>

    
“Apollo pitied him.—And when Daedalion<lb/>
leaped over the steep cliff, Apollo's power<lb/>
transformed him to a bird; supported him<lb/>
while he was hovering in the air upon<lb/>
uncertain wings, of such a sudden growth.<lb/>
Apollo, also, gave him a curved beak,<lb/>
and to his slender toes gave crooked claws.<lb/>
His former courage still remains, with strength<lb/>
greater than usual in birds. He changed<lb/>
to a fierce hawk; cruel to all, he vents<lb/>
his rage on other birds. Grieving himself<lb/>
he is a cause of grief to all his kind.”<lb/>

PELEUS AND THE WOLF

While Ceyx, the royal son of Lucifer,<lb/>
told these great wonders of his brother's life;<lb/>
Onetor, who had watched the while those herds<lb/>
which Peleus had assigned to him, ran up<lb/>
with panting speed; and cried out as he ran,<lb/>
“Peleus, Peleus! I bring you dreadful news!”<lb/>
Peleus asked him to tell what had gone wrong<lb/>
and with King Ceyx he listened in suspense.<lb/>


    
“I drove the weary bullocks to the shore,”<lb/>
Onetor then began, “About the time<lb/>
when the high burning Sun in middle course,<lb/>
could look back on as much as might be seen<lb/>
remaining: and some cattle had then bent<lb/>
their knees on yellow sand; and as they lay<lb/>
might view the expanse of water stretched beyond.<lb/>
Some with slow steps were wandering here and there,<lb/>
and others swimming, stretched their lofty necks<lb/>
above the waves. A temple near that sea<lb/>
was fair to view, although 'twas not adorned<lb/>
with gold nor marble. It was richly made<lb/>
of beams, and shaded with an ancient grove.<lb/>

    
“A sailor, while he dried his nets upon<lb/>
the shore nearby, declared that aged Nereus<lb/>
possessed it with his Nereids, as the gods<lb/>
who ruled the neighboring waters. Very near<lb/>
it is a marsh, made by the encroaching waves,<lb/>
all thickly covered with low willow trees.<lb/>

    
“From there a loud uncanny crashing sound<lb/>
alarms the neighborhood. A monster-wolf!<lb/>
All stained with mud he breaks forth from the marsh,<lb/>
his thundering jaws thick-covered with vile foam<lb/>
and clotted blood—his fierce eyes flashing flames<lb/>
of crimson: and though he was raging, both<lb/>
with fury and with hunger, the true cause<lb/>
of his fierce passions was Ferocity.<lb/>

    
“He never paused to sate his ravenous hunger<lb/>
with the first cattle that he fell upon,<lb/>
but mangled the whole herd, as if at war.<lb/>
And some of us, while we defended them,<lb/>
were wounded with his fatal bite and killed.—<lb/>
the shore and nearest waves were red with blood,<lb/>
and marshy fens were filled with mournful sounds—<lb/>
the longings of our cattle.—This delay<lb/>
is dangerous. We must not hesitate.<lb/>
We must unite before all is destroyed!<lb/>
Take up your arms. Arm! and unite, I say!<lb/>
And bear our weapons for the cause of Right!”<lb/>

    
So spoke the countryman, and yet the loss<lb/>
had no effect on Peleus, though severe,<lb/>
for he, remembering his red crime, believed<lb/>
the Nereid had given him that loss—<lb/>
a just misfortune, as an offering<lb/>
to the departed Phocus. After this,<lb/>
King Ceyx, while he put his armor on,<lb/>
ordered his men to arm themselves with their<lb/>
best weapons, and to follow his command.<lb/>
But his fond wife, Halcyone, aroused<lb/>
by such a tumult, ran to him in haste;<lb/>
in such haste that her hair was still unfinished,<lb/>
and such as had been done, she threw<lb/>
in wild disorder.—Clinging to the neck<lb/>
of her loved husband, she entreated him<lb/>
with words and tears, to send his men along.<lb/>
But keep himself at home and so to save<lb/>
two lives in one.<lb/>

    
But Peleus said “O queen,<lb/>
'Tis sweet and commendable in you to fear<lb/>
but needless. Though you promise generous aid,<lb/>
my hope lies not in fighting with the beast,<lb/>
I must appease a goddess of the sea.<lb/>
And the divinity of ocean must<lb/>
be properly adored.”<lb/>

    
A lofty tower<lb/>
is near there, and upon its extreme height<lb/>
a signal-fire is burning night and day,<lb/>
known to the grateful ships. They all went there;<lb/>
and from its summit they beheld with sighs,<lb/>
the mangled cattle scattered on the shore,<lb/>
and saw the ravager among the herd,<lb/>
his blood-stained jaws and long hair dripping blood.<lb/>

    
Then Peleus stretched his arms out towards the sea,<lb/>
and he implored the azure Psamathe<lb/>
to lay aside her wrath and give him aid.<lb/>
But she was deaf to any word of Peleus<lb/>
entreating her, and would not offer aid,<lb/>
till Thetis, interceding on behalf<lb/>
of her afflicted husband, moved her will.<lb/>

    
The monster-wolf persisted in his rage,<lb/>
even when the sea nymph bade him turn aside.<lb/>
His keen ferocity increased by taste<lb/>
of new sweet blood; till Psamathe, while he<lb/>
was seizing the last mangled heifer's neck,<lb/>
transformed him to hard marble. Every part<lb/>
of that ferocious monster's shape remained<lb/>
but it was changed to marble colored stone,<lb/>
which showed the monster was no more a wolf,<lb/>
and should no longer be a cause of fear.<lb/>

    
But still, the guiding Fates did not permit<lb/>
the banished Peleus to continue there,<lb/>
in this land governed by the friendly king.<lb/>
A wandering exile, he proceeded north<lb/>
into Magnesia; and was purified<lb/>
of guilt by King Acastus of that land.<lb/>


Ceyx et Alcyone. Somnus.
CEYX AND HALCYONE

King Ceyx, disturbed by his loved brother's fate<lb/>
and prodigies which happened since that time,<lb/>
prepared to venture to the Clarian god,<lb/>
that he might there consult the oracle,<lb/>
so sanctified to consolation of distress:<lb/>
for then the way to Delphi was unsafe<lb/>
because of Phorbas and his Phlegyans.<lb/>
Before he went he told his faithful queen,<lb/>
his dear Halcyone. She felt at once<lb/>
terror creep through the marrow of her bones,<lb/>
pallor of boxwood overspread her face,<lb/>
and her two cheeks were wet with gushing tears.<lb/>
Three times she tried to speak while tears and sobs<lb/>
delayed her voice, until at last she said:—<lb/>

    
“What fault of mine, my dearest, has so changed<lb/>
your usual thoughts? Where is that care for me<lb/>
that always has stood first? Can you leave me<lb/>
for this long journey with no anxious fear—<lb/>
Halcyone, forsaken in these halls?<lb/>
Will this long journey be a pleasant change<lb/>
because far from you I should be more dear?<lb/>
Perhaps you think you will go there by land,<lb/>
and I shall only grieve, and shall not fear<lb/>
the sea affrights me with its tragic face.<lb/>
Just lately I observed some broken planks<lb/>
upon our seashore, and I've read and read<lb/>
the names of seamen on their empty tombs!<lb/>

    
“Oh, let no false assurance fill your mind<lb/>
because your father-in-law is Aeolus.<lb/>
Who in a dungeon shuts the stormful winds<lb/>
and smoothes at will the troubled ocean waves<lb/>
soon as the winds get freedom from his power,<lb/>
they take entire possession of the deep,<lb/>
and nothing is forbidden their attack;<lb/>
and all the rights of every land and sea<lb/>
are disregarded by them. They insult<lb/>
even the clouds of heaven and their wild<lb/>
concussions urge the lightnings to strike fires.<lb/>
The more I know of them, for I knew<lb/>
them in my childhood and I often saw<lb/>
them from my father's home, the more I fear.<lb/>

    
“But, O dear husband! if this new resolve<lb/>
can not be altered by my prayers and fears,<lb/>
and if you are determined, take me, too:<lb/>
some comfort may be gained, if in the storms<lb/>
we may be tossed together. I shall fear<lb/>
only the ills that really come to us,<lb/>
together we can certainly endure<lb/>
discomforts till we gain that distant land.”<lb/>

    
Such words and tears of the daughter of Aeolus<lb/>
gave Ceyx, famed son of the Morning Star,<lb/>
much thought and sorrow; for the flame of love<lb/>
burned in his heart as strongly as in hers.<lb/>

    
Reluctant to give up the voyage, even more<lb/>
to make Halcyone his partner on<lb/>
the dangerous sea, he answered her complaints<lb/>
in many ways to pacify her breast,<lb/>
but could not comfort her until at last<lb/>
he said, “This separation from your love<lb/>
will be most sorrowful; and so I swear<lb/>
to you, as witnessed by the sacred fire<lb/>
of my Star-father, if the fates permit<lb/>
my safe return, I will come back to you<lb/>
before the moon has rounded twice her orb.”<lb/>

    
These promises gave hope of his return.<lb/>
Without delay he ordered a ship should<lb/>
be drawn forth from the dock, launched in the sea,<lb/>
and properly supplied against the needs<lb/>
of travel.—Seeing this, Halcyone,<lb/>
as if aware of future woe, shuddered,<lb/>
wept, and embraced him, and in extreme woe<lb/>
said with a sad voice, “Ah—Farewell!” and then,<lb/>
her nerveless body sank down to the ground.<lb/>

    
While Ceyx longed for some pretext to delay,<lb/>
the youthful oarsmen, chosen for their strength,<lb/>
in double rows began to draw the oars<lb/>
back towards their hardy breasts, cutting the waves<lb/>
with equal strokes. She raised her weeping eyes<lb/>
and saw her husband on the high-curved stern.<lb/>
He by his waving hand made signs to her,<lb/>
and she returned his signals. Then the ship<lb/>
moved farther from the shore until her eyes<lb/>
could not distinguish his loved countenance.<lb/>
Still, while she could, she followed with her gaze<lb/>
the fading hull; and, when that too was lost<lb/>
far in the distance, she remained and gazed<lb/>
at the white topsails, waving from the mast.<lb/>
But, when she could no longer see the sails,<lb/>
with anxious heart she sought her lonely couch<lb/>
and laid herself upon it. Couch and room<lb/>
renewed her sorrow and reminded her<lb/>
how much of life was absent on the sea.<lb/>

    
The ship had left the harbor, and the breeze<lb/>
shook the taut rigging. Now the captain bade<lb/>
the idle oars be drawn up to the sides.<lb/>
They ran the pointed sailyards up the mast<lb/>
and with spread canvas caught the coming breeze.<lb/>

    
Perhaps the ship had not sailed half her course,<lb/>
on every side the land was out of sight<lb/>
in fact at a great distance, when, towards dark<lb/>
the sea grew white with its increasing waves,<lb/>
while boisterous east winds blew with violence.—<lb/>
prompt in his duty, the captain warns his crew,<lb/>
“Lower the top sails—quick—furl all the sails<lb/>
tight to the yards!”—He ordered, but the storm<lb/>
bore all his words away, his voice could not<lb/>
be heard above the roaring of the sea.<lb/>

    
But of their own accord some sailors rushed<lb/>
to draw the oars in, others to secure<lb/>
the sides from danger, and some strove to pull<lb/>
the sails down from the wind. One pumps the waves<lb/>
up from the hold, and pours the rushing sea<lb/>
again into the sea; another takes<lb/>
the yards off.—While such things are being done<lb/>
without command or order, the wild storm<lb/>
increases, and on every side fierce winds<lb/>
wage a destructive warfare, which stirs up<lb/>
the furious waters to their utmost power.<lb/>

    
Even the captain, terrified, confessed<lb/>
he did not know the status of the ship,<lb/>
and could not order nor forbid the men—<lb/>
so great the storm, so far beyond his skill.<lb/>

    
Then he gave up control, while frightened men<lb/>
shouted above the rattled cordage shocks,<lb/>
and heavy waves were dashed against huge waves,<lb/>
and ail the sky reverberated with<lb/>
terrific thunders. The deep sea upturned<lb/>
tremendous billows, which appeared to reach<lb/>
so near the heaven they touched the heavy clouds<lb/>
with foam of their tossed waters.—At one time,<lb/>
while the great billows churned up yellow sand<lb/>
from off the bottom, the wild rolling waves<lb/>
were of that color. At another time<lb/>
they were more black than water of the Styx.<lb/>
Sometimes they levelled, white with lashing foam.<lb/>


    
The ship was tossed about in the wild storm:<lb/>
aloft as from a mountain peak it seemed<lb/>
to look down on the valley and the depth<lb/>
of Acheron; and, when sunk down in a trough<lb/>
of waves engulfing, it appeared to look<lb/>
up at the zenith from infernal seas.<lb/>
Often the waves fell on the sides with crash<lb/>
as terrible as when a flying stone<lb/>
or iron ram shatters a citadel.<lb/>

    
As lions, mustering up their strength anew,<lb/>
might hurl their breasts against the spears<lb/>
and outstretched arms of huntsmen, so the waves,<lb/>
upon the rising of the winds, rushed forth<lb/>
against the battered sides of the tossed ship<lb/>
and rose much higher than the slanting masts.<lb/>

    
The ship-bolts lost their grip, the loosened planks,<lb/>
despoiled of covering wax, gave open seams,<lb/>
through which streamed water of the fatal waves.—<lb/>
vast sheets of rain pour from dissolving clouds,<lb/>
so suddenly, it seemed that all the heavens<lb/>
were flung into the deep, while swelling seas<lb/>
ascended to the emptied fields of heaven!<lb/>

    
The sails are drenched with rain, the salt sea waves<lb/>
are mingled with the waters of the skies.<lb/>
The firmament is black without a star,<lb/>
and night is doubly dark with its own gloom<lb/>
and blackness of the storm. Quick lightning makes<lb/>
the black skies glitter, and the waves are fired<lb/>
with flames of thunder-bolts. Now floods leap up<lb/>
into the very middle of the ship.<lb/>

    
Just as a soldier, more courageous than<lb/>
the rest of his brave fellows, after he<lb/>
has often charged against the embattled walls<lb/>
of a defended city, gains at length<lb/>
the place which he has fought for; all inflamed<lb/>
with his desire of glory, scales the wall<lb/>
and stands alone among a thousand foes;<lb/>
so, when destructive waves have beat against<lb/>
the ship's high sides, the tenth wave with known power,<lb/>
rushes more furious than the nine before,<lb/>
nor ceases to attack the failing ship,<lb/>
until dashed high above the captured walls<lb/>
it surges in the hold. Part of the sea<lb/>
is still attempting to get in the ship,<lb/>
and part is in it. All are panic stricken,<lb/>
like men within a doomed and shaken town;<lb/>
who see some foes attack the walls without,<lb/>
and others hold possession of the walls<lb/>
within the city. Every art has failed,<lb/>
their courage sinks. With every coming wave<lb/>
another death seems rushing in upon them.<lb/>

    
One sailor yields in tears; another falls<lb/>
down, stupefied; another calls those blest<lb/>
whom funeral rites await; another prays,<lb/>
addressing trusted gods, lifting his hands<lb/>
up to that heaven unseen, as vainly he<lb/>
implores some aid divine, and one in fright<lb/>
recalls his brothers and his parent, while<lb/>
another names his children and his home:<lb/>
each frightened sailor thinks of all he left.<lb/>

    
King Ceyx thinks only of Halcyone,<lb/>
no other name is on his lips but hers:<lb/>
and though he longs for her, yet he is glad<lb/>
that she is safe at home. Ah, how he tried<lb/>
to look back to the shore of his loved land,<lb/>
to turn his last gaze towards his wife and home.<lb/>
But he has lost direction.—The tossed sea<lb/>
is raging in a hurricane so vast,<lb/>
and all the sky is hidden by the gloom<lb/>
of thickened storm-clouds, doubled in pitch-black.<lb/>

    
The mast is shattered by the violence<lb/>
of drenching tempests, and the useless helm<lb/>
is broken. One undaunted giant wave<lb/>
stands over wreck and spoil, and looks down like<lb/>
a conqueror upon the other waves:<lb/>
then falls as heavily as if some god<lb/>
should hurl Mount Athos or Mount Pindus, torn<lb/>
from rock foundations, into that wide sea:<lb/>
so, with down-rushing weight and violence<lb/>
it struck and plunged the ship to the lowest deeps.<lb/>
And as the ship sank, many of the crew<lb/>
sank overwhelmed in deep surrounding waves,<lb/>
never to rise from suffocating death:<lb/>
but some in desperation, clung for life<lb/>
to broken timbers and escaped that fate.<lb/>

    
King Ceyx clung to a fragment of the wreck<lb/>
with that majestic hand which often before<lb/>
had proudly swayed the sceptre. And in vain,<lb/>
alas, he called upon his father's name,<lb/>
alas, he begged his father-in-law's support.<lb/>
But, while he swam, his lips most frequently<lb/>
pronounced that dearest name, “Halcyone!”<lb/>
He longs to have his body carried by waves<lb/>
to her dear gaze and have at last,<lb/>
entombment by the hands of his loved friends.<lb/>
Swimming, he called Halcyone—far off,<lb/>
as often as the billows would allow<lb/>
his lips to open, and among the waves<lb/>
his darling's name was murmured, till at last<lb/>
a night-black arch of water swept above<lb/>
the highest waves and buried him beneath<lb/>
engulfing billows.<lb/>

    
Lucifer was dim<lb/>
past recognition when the dawn appeared<lb/>
and, since he never could depart from heaven,<lb/>
soon hid his grieving countenance in clouds.<lb/>

    
Meanwhile, Halcyone, all unaware<lb/>
of his sad wreck, counts off the passing nights<lb/>
and hastens to prepare for him his clothes<lb/>
that he may wear as soon as he returns to her;<lb/>
and she is choosing what to wear herself,<lb/>
and vainly promises his safe return—<lb/>
all this indeed, while she in hallowed prayer<lb/>
is giving frankincense to please the gods:<lb/>
and first of loving adorations, she<lb/>
paid at the shrine of Juno. There she prayed<lb/>
for Ceyx—after he had suffered death,<lb/>
that he might journey safely and return<lb/>
and might love her above all other women,<lb/>
this one last prayer alone was granted to her<lb/>

    
but Juno could not long accept as hers<lb/>
these supplications on behalf of one<lb/>
then dead; and that she might persuade Halcyone<lb/>
to turn her death-polluted hands away<lb/>
from hallowed altars, Juno said in haste,<lb/>
“O, Iris, best of all my messengers,<lb/>
go quickly to the dreadful court of Sleep,<lb/>
and in my name command him to despatch<lb/>
a dream in the shape of Ceyx, who is dead,<lb/>
and tell Halcyone the woeful truth.”<lb/>

    
So she commanded.—Iris instantly<lb/>
assumed a garment of a thousand tints;<lb/>
and as she marked the high skies with her arch,<lb/>
went swiftly thence as ordered, to the place<lb/>
where Sleep was then concealed beneath a rock.<lb/>


    
Near the Cimmerian Land there is a cave,<lb/>
with a long entrance, in a hallowed mountain,<lb/>
the home of slothful Sleep. To that dark cave<lb/>
the Sun, when rising or in middle skies,<lb/>
or setting, never can approach with light.<lb/>
There dense fogs, mingled with the dark, exhale<lb/>
darkness from the black soil—and all that place<lb/>
is shadowed in a deep mysterious gloom.<lb/>

    
No wakeful bird with visage crested high<lb/>
calls forth the morning's beauty in clear notes;<lb/>
nor do the watchful dogs, more watchful geese,<lb/>
nor wild beasts, cattle, nor the waving trees,<lb/>
make sound or whisper; and the human voice<lb/>
is never heard there—silent Rest is there.<lb/>
But, from the bottom of a rock beneath,<lb/>
Lethean waters of a stream ooze forth,<lb/>
sounds of a rivulet, which trickle with<lb/>
soft murmuring amid the pebbles and<lb/>
invite soft sleep. Before the cavern doors<lb/>
most fertile poppies and a wealth of herbs<lb/>
bloom in abundance, from the juice of which<lb/>
the humid night-hours gather sleep and spread<lb/>
it over darkened Earth. No door is in<lb/>
that cavern-home and not a hinge's noise<lb/>
nor guarding porter's voice disturbs the calm.<lb/>
But in the middle is a resting-couch,<lb/>
raised high on night-black ebony and soft<lb/>
with feathered cushions, all jet black, concealed<lb/>
by a rich coverlet as dark as night,<lb/>
on which the god of sleep, dissolved in sloth<lb/>
lies with unmoving limbs. Around him there<lb/>
in all directions, unsubstantial dreams<lb/>
recline in imitation of all shapes—<lb/>
as many as the uncounted ears of corn<lb/>
at harvest—as the myriad leaves of trees—<lb/>
or tiny sand grains spread upon the shore.<lb/>

    
As soon as Iris entered that dread gloom,<lb/>
she pushed aside the visions in her way<lb/>
with her fair glowing hands; and instantly,<lb/>
that sacred cavern of the god of Sleep<lb/>
was all illuminated with the glow<lb/>
and splendor of her garment.—Out of himself<lb/>
the god with difficulty lifted up<lb/>
his lanquid eyes. From this small sign of life<lb/>
relapsing many times to languid sloth,<lb/>
while nodding, with his chin he struck his breast<lb/>
again and again. At last he roused himself<lb/>
from gloom and slumber; and, while raised upon<lb/>
his elbow, he enquired of Iris why<lb/>
she came to him.—He knew her by her name.<lb/>

    
She answered him, “O, Sleep, divine repose<lb/>
of all things! Gentlest of the deities!<lb/>
Peace to the troubled mind, from which you drive<lb/>
the cares of life, restorer of men's strength<lb/>
when wearied with the toils of day, command<lb/>
a vision that shall seem the actual form<lb/>
of royal Ceyx to visit Trachin famed<lb/>
for Hercules and tell Halcyone<lb/>
his death by shipwreck. It is Juno's wish.”<lb/>

    
Iris departed after this was said.<lb/>
For she no longer could endure the effect<lb/>
of slumber-vapor; and as soon as she<lb/>
knew sleep was creeping over her tired limbs<lb/>
she flew from there—and she departed by<lb/>
the rainbow, over which she came before.<lb/>

    
Out of the multitude—his thousand sons—<lb/>
the god of sleep raised Morpheus by his power.<lb/>
Most skillful of his sons, who had the art<lb/>
of imitating any human shape;<lb/>
and dexterously could imitate in men<lb/>
the gait and countenance, and every mode<lb/>
of speaking. He could simulate the dress<lb/>
and customary words of any man<lb/>
he chose to represent—but he could not<lb/>
assume the form of anything but man.<lb/>

    
Such was his art. Another of Sleep's sons<lb/>
could imitate all kinds of animals;<lb/>
such as a wild beast or a flying bird,<lb/>
or even a serpent with its twisted shape;<lb/>
and that son, by the gods above was called<lb/>
Icelos—but the inhabitants of earth<lb/>
called him Phobetor—and a third son, named<lb/>
Phantasos, cleverly could change himself<lb/>
into the forms of earth that have no life;<lb/>
into a statue, water, or a tree.<lb/>

    
It was the habit of these three to show<lb/>
themselves at night to kings and generals;<lb/>
and other sons would frequently appear<lb/>
among the people of the common class.<lb/>
All such the aged god of Sleep passed by.<lb/>
Selecting only Morpheus from among<lb/>
the many brothers to accomplish this,<lb/>
and execute what Iris had desired.<lb/>
And after all that work, he dropped his head,<lb/>
and sank again in languid drowsiness,<lb/>
shrinking to sloth within his lofty couch.<lb/>

    
Morpheus at once flew through the night<lb/>
of darkness, on his wings that make no sound,<lb/>
and in brief space of intervening time,<lb/>
arrived at the Haemonian city walls;<lb/>
and there he laid aside his wings, and took<lb/>
the face and form of Ceyx. In that form<lb/>
as one deprived of life, devoid of clothes,<lb/>
wan and ghastly, he stood beside the bed<lb/>
of the sad wife. The hero's beard seemed dripping,<lb/>
sea water streamed down from his drenching hair.<lb/>

    
Then leaning on the bed, while dropping tears<lb/>
were running down his cheeks, he said these words:<lb/>
“Most wretched wife, can you still recognize<lb/>
your own loved Ceyx, or have my looks changed:<lb/>
so much with death you can not?—Look at me,<lb/>
and you will be assured I am your own:<lb/>
but here instead of your dear husband, you<lb/>
will find only his ghost. Your faithful prayers<lb/>
did not avail, Halcyone, and I<lb/>
have perished. Give up all deluding hopes<lb/>
of my return. The stormy Southwind caught<lb/>
my ship while sailing the Aegean sea;<lb/>
and there, tossed by the mighty wind, my ship<lb/>
was dashed to pieces. While I vainly called<lb/>
upon your name, the angry waters closed<lb/>
above my drowning head and it is no<lb/>
uncertain messenger that tells you this<lb/>
and nothing from vague rumors has been told.<lb/>
But it is I myself, come from the wreck,<lb/>
now telling you my fate. Come then, arise<lb/>
shed tears, and put on mourning; do not send<lb/>
me unlamented, down to Tartarus.”<lb/>

    
And Morpheus added to these words a voice<lb/>
which she would certainly believe was her<lb/>
beloved husband's; and he seemed to be<lb/>
shedding fond human tears; and even his hands<lb/>
were moved in gestures that Ceyx often used.<lb/>

    
Halcyone shed tears and groaned aloud,<lb/>
and, as she moved her arms and caught at his<lb/>
dear body, she embraced the vacant air<lb/>
she cried out loudly, “Stay, oh stay with me!<lb/>
Why do you hurry from me? We will go<lb/>
together!” Agitated by her own<lb/>
excited voice; and by what seemed to be<lb/>
her own dear husband, she awoke from sleep.<lb/>
And first looked all about her to persuade<lb/>
herself that he whom she had lately seen<lb/>
must yet be with her, for she had aroused<lb/>
the servants who in haste brought lights desired.<lb/>

    
When she could find him nowhere, in despair<lb/>
she struck her face and tore her garment from<lb/>
her breast and beat her breast with mourning hands.<lb/>
She did not wait to loosen her long hair;<lb/>
but tore it with her hands and to her nurse,<lb/>
who asked the cause of her wild grief, she cried:<lb/>
“Alas, Halcyone is no more! no more! <lb/>
with her own Ceyx she is dead! is dead!<lb/>
Away with words of comfort, he is lost<lb/>
by shipwreck! I have seen him, and I knew<lb/>
him surely—as a ghost he came to me;<lb/>
and when desirous to detain him, I<lb/>
stretched forth my arms to him, his ghost left me—<lb/>
it vanished from me; but it surely was<lb/>
the ghost of my dead husband. If you ask<lb/>
description of it, I must truly say<lb/>
he did not have his well known features—he<lb/>
was not so cheerful as he was in life!<lb/>
Alas, I saw him pale and naked, with<lb/>
his hair still dripping—his ghost from the waves<lb/>
stood on this very spot:” and while she moaned<lb/>
she sought his footprints on the floor. “Alas,<lb/>
this was my fear, and this is what my mind<lb/>
shuddered to think of, when I begged that you<lb/>
would not desert me for the wind's control.<lb/>
But how I wish, since you were sailing forth<lb/>
to perish, that you had but taken me<lb/>
with you. If I had gone with you, it would<lb/>
have been advantage to me, for I should<lb/>
have shared the whole course of my life with you<lb/>
and you would not have met a separate death.<lb/>
I linger here but I have met my death,<lb/>
I toss on waves, and drift upon the sea.<lb/>

    
“My heart would be more cruel than the waves,<lb/>
if it should ask me to endure this life—<lb/>
if I should struggle to survive such grief.<lb/>
I will not strive nor leave you so forlorn,<lb/>
at least I'll follow you to death. If not<lb/>
the urn at least the lettered stone<lb/>
shall keep us still together. If your bones<lb/>
are not united with my bones, 'tis sure<lb/>
our names must be united.”Overcome<lb/>
with grief, she could not say another word—<lb/>
but she continued wailing, and her groans<lb/>
were heaved up from her sorrow-stricken breast.<lb/>

    
At early dawn, she went from her abode<lb/>
down to the seashore, where most wretchedly,<lb/>
she stood upon the spot from which he sailed,<lb/>
and sadly said; “He lingered here while he<lb/>
was loosening the cables, and he kissed<lb/>
me on this seashore when he left me here.”<lb/>
And while she called to recollection all<lb/>
that she had seen when standing there, and while<lb/>
she looked far out on flowing waves from there,<lb/>
she noticed floating on the distant sea—<lb/>
what shall I say? At first even she could not<lb/>
be sure of what she saw. But presently<lb/>
although still distant—it was certainly<lb/>
a floating corpse. She could not see what man<lb/>
he might be, but because it seemed to her<lb/>
it surely was a shipwrecked body, she<lb/>
was moved as at an omen and began<lb/>
to weep; and, moaning as she stood there, said:—<lb/>
“Ah wretched one, whoever it may be,<lb/>
ah, wretched is the wife whom you have left!”<lb/>

    
As driven by the waves the body came<lb/>
still nearer to her, she was less and less<lb/>
the mistress of herself, the more she looked<lb/>
upon it; and, when it was close enough<lb/>
for her to see its features, she beheld<lb/>
her husband. “It is he,” she cried and then<lb/>
she tore her face, her hair, her royal robe<lb/>
and then, extending both her trembling hands<lb/>
towards Ceyx, “So dearest one! So do you come<lb/>
to me again?” She cried, “O luckless mate.”<lb/>

    
A mole, made by the craft of man, adjoins<lb/>
the sea and breaks the shoreward rush of waves.<lb/>
To this she leaped—it seemed impossible—<lb/>
and then, while beating the light air with wings<lb/>
that instant formed upon her, she flew on,<lb/>
a mourning bird, and skimmed above the waves.<lb/>
And while she lightly flew across the sea<lb/>
her clacking mouth with its long slender bill,<lb/>
full of complaining, uttered moaning sounds:<lb/>
but when she touched the still and pallied form,<lb/>
embracing his dear limbs with her new wings,<lb/>
she gave cold kisses with her hardened bill.<lb/>

    
All those who saw it doubted whether Ceyx<lb/>
could feel her kisses; and it seemed to them<lb/>
the moving waves had raised his countenance.<lb/>
But he was truly conscious of her grief;<lb/>
and through the pity of the gods above,<lb/>
at last they both were changed to flying birds,<lb/>
together in their fate. Their love lived on,<lb/>
nor in these birds were marriage bonds dissolved,<lb/>
and they soon coupled and were parent birds.<lb/>
Each winter during seven full days of calm<lb/>
Halcyone broods on her floating nest—<lb/>
her nest that sails upon a halcyon sea:<lb/>
the passage of the deep is free from storms,<lb/>
throughout those seven full days; and Aeolus<lb/>
restraining harmful winds, within their cave,<lb/>
for his descendants' sake gives halcyon seas.<lb/>


Aesacos.
HESPERIA AND AESACUS

An old man saw the two birds fly across<lb/>
the wide extended sea and praised their love,<lb/>
undying to the end. His old friend who<lb/>
stood near him, said, “There is another bird,<lb/>
which you can see skimming above the waves<lb/>
with folded legs drawn up;” and as he spoke,<lb/>
he pointed at a divedapper, which had<lb/>
a long throat, and continued, “It was first<lb/>
the son of a great king, as Ceyx, was:<lb/>
and if you wish to know his ancestry,<lb/>
I can assure you he descended from<lb/>
Ilus, Assaracus, and Ganymede—<lb/>
taken by Jupiter, and old Laomedon,<lb/>
and Priam, ruler at the fall of Troy.<lb/>

    
“Aesacus was the brother of the great<lb/>
illustrious Hector; and, if he had not<lb/>
been victimized by a strange fate in youth,<lb/>
he would have equalled Hector's glorious fame,<lb/>
Hector was child of Hecuba, who was<lb/>
daughter of Dymas. Alexirhoe,<lb/>
the daughter of the two-horned Granicus,<lb/>
so rumor has it, secretly brought forth<lb/>
Aesacus, hidden under Ida's shade.<lb/>

    
“He loathed the city and away from court,<lb/>
frequented lonely mountains and the fields<lb/>
of unambitious peasants. Rarely he<lb/>
was seen among the throngs of Ilium.—<lb/>
yet, neither churlish nor impregnable<lb/>
to love's appeal, he saw Hesperia,<lb/>
the daughter of Cebrenus, while she was<lb/>
once resting on the velvet-shaded banks<lb/>
of her sire's cherished stream. Aesacus had<lb/>
so often sought for her throughout the woods.<lb/>

    
“Just when he saw her, while she rested there,<lb/>
her hair spread on her shoulders to the sun,<lb/>
she saw him, and without delay she fled,<lb/>
even as the frightened deer runs from the wolf<lb/>
or as the water-duck, when she has left<lb/>
her favored stream, surprised, flies from the hawk.<lb/>
Aesacus followed her, as swift with love<lb/>
as she was swift with fear. But in the grass<lb/>
a lurking snake struck at her rosy heel<lb/>
and left its venom in her flesh.—And so,<lb/>
her flight was ended by untimely death.<lb/>

    
“Oh, frantic, he embraced her breathless form,<lb/>
and cried: ‘Alas, alas, that I pursued!<lb/>
I did not dream of such a dreadful fate!<lb/>
Success was not worth such a price<lb/>
I and the snake together caused your death—<lb/>
the serpent gave the wound, I was the cause.<lb/>
Mine is the greater guilt, and by my death<lb/>
I'll give you consolation for your death!’ ”<lb/>

    
“He said those words and leaped on a high rock,<lb/>
which years of sounding waves had undermined,<lb/>
and hurled himself into the sea below.<lb/>

    
“Tethys was moved with pity for his fall,<lb/>
received him softly, and then covered him<lb/>
with feathers, as he swam among the waves.<lb/>
The death he sought for was not granted him.<lb/>
At this the lover was wroth. Against his will,<lb/>
he was obliged to live in his distress,<lb/>
with opposition to his spirit that desired<lb/>
departure from the wretched pain of life.<lb/>

    
“As he assumed upon his shoulders wings<lb/>
newformed, he flew aloft and from that height<lb/>
again he plunged his body in the waves<lb/>
his feathers broke all danger of that fall—<lb/>
and this new bird, Aesacus, plunged headlong<lb/>
into the deep, and tried incessantly<lb/>
that method of destruction. His great love<lb/>
unsatisfied, made his sad body lean,<lb/>
till even the spaces fixed between the joints<lb/>
of his legs have grown long; his neck is long;<lb/>
so that his head is far away from his<lb/>
lean body. Still he hunts the sea<lb/>
and takes his name from diving in the waves.<lb/>

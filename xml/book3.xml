Cadmus.
CADMUS AND THE DRAGONTHE HOUSE OF CADMUS

<l>Now Jupiter had not revealed himself,</l>
<l>nor laid aside the semblance of a bull,</l>
<l>until they stood upon the plains of Crete.</l>

    
<l>But not aware of this, her father bade</l>
<l>her brother Cadmus search through all the world,</l>
<l>until he found his sister, and proclaimed</l>
<l>him doomed to exile if he found her not;—</l>
<l>thus was he good and wicked in one deed.</l>
<l>When he had vainly wandered over the earth</l>
<l>(for who can fathom the deceits of Jove?)</l>
<l>Cadmus, the son of King Agenor, shunned</l>
<l>his country and his father's mighty wrath.</l>

    
<l>But he consulted the famed oracles</l>
<l>of Phoebus, and enquired of them what land</l>
<l>might offer him a refuge and a home.</l>
<l>And Phoebus answered him; “When on the plains</l>
<l>a heifer, that has never known the yoke,</l>
<l>shall cross thy path go thou thy way with her,</l>
<l>and follow where she leads; and when she lies,</l>
<l>to rest herself upon the meadow green,</l>
<l>there shalt thou stop, as it will be a sign</l>
<l>for thee to build upon that plain the walls</l>
<l>of a great city: and its name shall be</l>
<l>the City of Boeotia.”</l>

    
<l>Cadmus turned;</l>
<l>but hardly had descended from the cave,</l>
<l>Castalian, ere he saw a heifer go</l>
<l>unguarded, gentle-paced, without the scars</l>
<l>of labour on her neck. He followed close</l>
<l>upon her steps (and silently adored</l>
<l>celestial Phoebus, author of his way)</l>
<l>till over the channel that Cephissus wears</l>
<l>he forded to the fields of Panope</l>
<l>and even over to Boeotia.—</l>
<l>there stood the slow-paced heifer, and she raised</l>
<l>her forehead, broad with shapely horns, towards Heaven;</l>
<l>and as she filled the air with lowing, stretched</l>
<l>her side upon the tender grass, and turned</l>
<l>her gaze on him who followed in her path.</l>

    
<l>Cadmus gave thanks and kissed the foreign soil,</l>
<l>and offered salutation to the fields</l>
<l>and unexplored hills. Then he prepared</l>
<l>to make large sacrifice to Jupiter,</l>
<l>and ordered slaves to seek the living springs</l>
<l>whose waters in libation might be poured.</l>

    
<l>There was an ancient grove, whose branching trees</l>
<l>had never known the desecrating ax,</l>
<l>where hidden in the undergrowth a cave,</l>
<l>with oziers bending round its low-formed arch,</l>
<l>was hollowed in the jutting rocks—deep-found</l>
<l>in the dark center of that hallowed grove—</l>
<l>beneath its arched roof a beauteous stream</l>
<l>of water welled serene. Its gloom concealed</l>
<l>a dragon, sacred to the war-like Mars;</l>
<l>crested and gorgeous with radescent scales,</l>
<l>and eyes that sparkled as the glow of coals.</l>
<l>A deadly venom had puffed up his bulk,</l>
<l>and from his jaws he darted forth three tongues,</l>
<l>and in a triple row his sharp teeth stood.</l>

    
<l>Now those who ventured of the Tyrian race,</l>
<l>misfortuned followers of Cadmus, took</l>
<l>the path that led them to this grove; and when</l>
<l>they cast down-splashing in the springs an urn,</l>
<l>the hidden dragon stretched his azure head</l>
<l>out from the cavern's gloom, and vented forth</l>
<l>terrific hissings. Horrified they dropped</l>
<l>their urns. A sudden trembling shook their knees;</l>
<l>and their life-blood was ice within their veins.</l>

    
<l>The dragon wreathed his scales in rolling knots,</l>
<l>and with a spring, entwisted in great folds,</l>
<l>reared up his bulk beyond the middle rings,</l>
<l>high in the air from whence was given his gaze</l>
<l>the extreme confines of the grove below.</l>
<l>A size prodigious, his enormous bulk,</l>
<l>if seen extended where was naught to hide,</l>
<l>would rival in its length the Serpent's folds,</l>
<l>involved betwixt the planes of the Twin Bears.</l>
<l>The terrified Phoenicians, whether armed</l>
<l>for conflict, or in flight precipitate,</l>
<l>or whether held incapable from fear,</l>
<l>he seized with sudden rage; stung them to death,</l>
<l>or crushed them in the grasp of crushing folds,</l>
<l>or blasted with the poison of his breath.</l>

    
<l>High in the Heavens the sun small shadow made</l>
<l>when Cadmus, wondering what detained his men,</l>
<l>prepared to follow them. Clothed in a skin</l>
<l>torn from a lion, he was armed, complete,</l>
<l>with lance of glittering steel; and with a dart:</l>
<l>but passing these he had a dauntless soul.</l>

    
<l>When he explored the grove and there beheld</l>
<l>the lifeless bodies, and above them stretched</l>
<l>the vast victorious dragon licking up</l>
<l>the blood that issued from their ghastly wounds;</l>
<l>his red tongues dripping gore; then Cadmus filled</l>
<l>with rage and grief; “Behold, my faithful ones!</l>
<l>I will avenge your deaths or I will share it!”</l>

    
<l>He spoke; and lifted up a mill-stone huge,</l>
<l>in his right hand, and having poised it, hurled</l>
<l>with a tremendous effort dealing such</l>
<l>a blow would crush the strongest builded walls;</l>
<l>yet neither did the dragon flinch the shock</l>
<l>nor was he wounded, for his armour-scales,</l>
<l>fixed in his hard and swarthy hide, repelled</l>
<l>the dreadful impact. Not the javelin thus,</l>
<l>so surely by his armoured skin was foiled,</l>
<l>for through the middle segment of his spine</l>
<l>the steel point pierced, and sank beneath the flesh,</l>
<l>deep in his entrails. Writhing in great pain</l>
<l>he turned his head upon his bleeding back,</l>
<l>twisting the shaft, with force prodigious shook</l>
<l>it back and forth, and wrenched it from the wound;</l>
<l>with difficulty wrenched it. But the steel</l>
<l>remained securely fastened in his bones.</l>
<l>Such agony but made increase of rage:</l>
<l>his throat was swollen with great knotted veins;</l>
<l>a white froth gathered on his poisonous jaws;</l>
<l>the earth resounded with his rasping scales;</l>
<l>he breathed upon the grass a pestilence,</l>
<l>steaming mephitic from his Stygian mouth.</l>

    
<l>His body writhes up in tremendous gyres;</l>
<l>his folds, now straighter than a beam, untwist;</l>
<l>he rushes forward on his vengeful foe,</l>
<l>his great breast crushing the deep-rooted trees.</l>

    
<l>Small space gave Cadmus to the dragon's rage,</l>
<l>for by the lion's spoil he stood the shock,</l>
<l>and thrusting in his adversary's jaws</l>
<l>the trusted lance gave check his mad career.</l>
<l>Wild in his rage the dragon bit the steel</l>
<l>and fixed his teeth on the keen-biting point:</l>
<l>out from his poisoned palate streams of gore</l>
<l>spouted and stained the green with sanguine spray.</l>
<l>Yet slight the wound for he recoiled in time,</l>
<l>and drew his wounded body from the spear;</l>
<l>by shrinking from the sharp steel saved his throat</l>
<l>a mortal wound. But Cadmus as he pressed</l>
<l>the spear-point deeper in the serpent's throat,</l>
<l>pursued him till an oak-tree barred the way;</l>
<l>to this he fixed the dragon through the neck:</l>
<l>the stout trunk bending with the monster's weight,</l>
<l>groaned at the lashing of his serpent tail.</l>


    
<l>While the brave victor gazed upon the bulk</l>
<l>enormous of his vanquished foe, a voice</l>
<l>was heard—from whence was difficult to know,</l>
<l>but surely heard—“Son of Agenor, why</l>

    
<l>art thou here standing by this carcase-worm,</l>
<l>for others shall behold thy body changed</l>
<l>into a serpent?” Terrified, amazed,</l>
<l>he lost his colour and his self-control;</l>
<l>his hair stood upright from the dreadful fright.</l>

    
<l>But lo, the hero's watchful Deity,</l>
<l>Minerva, from the upper realms of air</l>
<l>appeared before him. She commanded him</l>
<l>to sow the dragon's teeth in mellowed soil,</l>
<l>from which might spring another race of men.</l>
<l>And he obeyed: and as he plowed the land,</l>
<l>took care to scatter in the furrowed soil</l>
<l>the dragon's teeth; a seed to raise up man.</l>

    
<l>'Tis marvelous but true, when this was done</l>
<l>the clods began to move. A spear-point first</l>
<l>appeared above the furrows, followed next</l>
<l>by helmet-covered heads, nodding their cones;</l>
<l>their shoulders, breasts and arms weighted with spears;</l>
<l>and largely grew the shielded crop of men.—</l>
<l>so is it in the joyful theaters</l>
<l>when the gay curtains, rolling from the floor,</l>
<l>are upward drawn until the scene is shown,—</l>
<l>it seems as if the figures rise to view:</l>
<l>first we behold their faces, then we see</l>
<l>their bodies, and their forms by slow degrees</l>
<l>appear before us on the painted cloth.</l>

    
<l>Cadmus, affrighted by this host, prepared</l>
<l>to arm for his defence; but one of those</l>
<l>from earth created cried; “Arm not! Away</l>
<l>from civil wars!” And with his trenchant sword</l>
<l>he smote an earth-born brother, hand to hand;</l>
<l>even as the vanquished so the victor fell,</l>
<l>pierced by a dart some distant brother hurled;</l>
<l>and likewise he who cast that dart was slain:</l>
<l>both breathing forth their lives upon the air</l>
<l>so briefly theirs, expired together. All</l>
<l>as if demented leaped in sudden rage,</l>
<l>each on the other, dealing mutual wounds.</l>

    
<l>So, having lived the space allotted them,</l>
<l>the youthful warriors perished as they smote</l>
<l>the earth (their blood-stained mother) with their breasts:</l>
<l>and only five of all the troop remained;</l>
<l>of whom Echion, by Minerva warned,</l>
<l>called on his brothers to give up the fight,</l>
<l>and cast his arms away in pledge of faith.—</l>
<l>when Cadmus, exiled from Sidonia's gates,</l>
<l>builded the city by Apollo named,</l>
<l>these five were trusted comrades in his toil.</l>

ACTAEONTHE HOUSE OF CADMUS

<l>Now Thebes is founded, who can deem thy days</l>
<l>unhappy in shine exile, Cadmus? Thou,</l>
<l>the son-in-law of Mars and Venus; thou,</l>
<l>whose glorious wife has borne to shine embrace</l>
<l>daughters and sons? And thy grandchildren join</l>
<l>around thee, almost grown to man's estate.—</l>
<l>nor should we say, “He leads a happy life,”</l>
<l>Till after death the funeral rites are paid.</l>


Actaeon.

<l>Thy grandson, Cadmus, was the first to cast</l>
<l>thy dear felicity in sorrow's gloom.</l>
<l>Oh, it was pitiful to witness him,</l>
<l>his horns outbranching from his forehead, chased</l>
<l>by dogs that panted for their master's blood!</l>
<l>If thou shouldst well inquire it will be shown</l>
<l>his sorrow was the crime of Fortune—not</l>
<l>his guilt—for who maintains mistakes are crimes?</l>

    
<l>Upon a mountain stained with slaughtered game,</l>
<l>the young Hyantian stood. Already day,</l>
<l>increasing to meridian, made decrease</l>
<l>the flitting shadows, and the hot sun shone</l>
<l>betwixt extremes in equal distance. Such</l>
<l>the hour, when speaking to his fellow friends,</l>
<l>the while they wandered by those lonely haunts,</l>
<l>actaeon of Hyantis kindly thus;</l>

<l>“Our nets and steel are stained with slaughtered game,</l>
<l>the day has filled its complement of sport;</l>
<l>now, when Aurora in her saffron car</l>
<l>brings back the light of day, we may again</l>
<l>repair to haunts of sport. Now Phoebus hangs</l>
<l>in middle sky, cleaving the fields with heat.—</l>
<l>enough of toil; take down the knotted nets.”—</l>
<l>all did as he commanded; and they sought</l>
<l>their needed rest.</l>

    
<l>There is a valley called</l>
<l>Gargaphia; sacred to Diana, dense</l>
<l>with pine trees and the pointed cypress, where,</l>
<l>deep in the woods that fringed the valley's edge,</l>
<l>was hollowed in frail sandstone and the soft</l>
<l>white pumice of the hills an arch, so true</l>
<l>it seemed the art of man; for Nature's touch</l>
<l>ingenious had so fairly wrought the stone,</l>
<l>making the entrance of a grotto cool.</l>
<l>Upon the right a limpid fountain ran,</l>
<l>and babbled, as its lucid channel spread</l>
<l>into a clear pool edged with tender grass.</l>
<l>Here, when a-wearied with exciting sport,</l>
<l>the Sylvan goddess loved to come and bathe</l>
<l>her virgin beauty in the crystal pool.</l>

    
<l>After Diana entered with her nymphs,</l>
<l>she gave her javelin, quiver and her bow</l>
<l>to one accustomed to the care of arms;</l>
<l>she gave her mantle to another nymph</l>
<l>who stood near by her as she took it off;</l>
<l>two others loosed the sandals from her feet;</l>
<l>but Crocale, the daughter of Ismenus,</l>
<l>more skillful than her sisters, gathered up</l>
<l>the goddess' scattered tresses in a knot;—</l>
<l>her own were loosely wantoned on the breeze.</l>

    
<l>Then in their ample urns dipt up the wave</l>
<l>and poured it forth, the cloud-nymph Nephele,</l>
<l>the nymph of crystal pools called Hyale,</l>
<l>the rain-drop Rhanis, Psecas of the dews,</l>
<l>and Phyale the guardian of their urns.</l>
<l>And while they bathed Diana in their streams,</l>
<l>Actaeon, wandering through the unknown woods,</l>
<l>entered the precincts of that sacred grove;</l>
<l>with steps uncertain wandered he as fate</l>
<l>directed, for his sport must wait till morn.—</l>
<l>soon as he entered where the clear springs welled</l>
<l>or trickled from the grotto's walls, the nymphs,</l>
<l>now ready for the bath, beheld the man,</l>
<l>smote on their breasts, and made the woods resound,</l>
<l>suddenly shrieking. Quickly gathered they</l>
<l>to shield Diana with their naked forms, but she</l>
<l>stood head and shoulders taller than her guards.—</l>
<l>as clouds bright-tinted by the slanting sun,</l>
<l>or purple-dyed Aurora, so appeared</l>
<l>Diana's countenance when she was seen.</l>

    
<l>Oh, how she wished her arrows were at hand!</l>
<l>But only having water, this she took</l>
<l>and dashed it on his manly countenance,</l>
<l>and sprinkled with the avenging stream his hair,</l>
<l>and said these words, presage of future woe;</l>
<l>“Go tell it, if your tongue can tell the tale,</l>
<l>your bold eyes saw me stripped of all my robes.”</l>
<l>No more she threatened, but she fixed the horns</l>
<l>of a great stag firm on his sprinkled brows;</l>
<l>she lengthened out his neck; she made his ears</l>
<l>sharp at the top; she changed his hands and feet;</l>
<l>made long legs of his arms, and covered him</l>
<l>with dappled hair—his courage turned to fear.</l>
<l>The brave son of Autonoe took to flight,</l>
<l>and marveled that he sped so swiftly on.—</l>

    
<l>he saw his horns reflected in a stream</l>
<l>and would have said, “Ah, wretched me!” but now</l>
<l>he had no voice, and he could only groan:</l>
<l>large tears ran trickling down his face, transformed</l>
<l>in every feature.—Yet, as clear remained</l>
<l>his understanding, and he wondered what</l>
<l>he should attempt to do: should he return</l>
<l>to his ancestral palace, or plunge deep</l>
<l>in vast vacuities of forest wilds?</l>
<l>Fear made him hesitate to trust the woods,</l>
<l>and shame deterred him from his homeward way.</l>

    
<l>While doubting thus his dogs espied him there:</l>
<l>first Blackfoot and the sharp nosed Tracer raised</l>
<l>the signal: Tracer of the Gnossian breed,</l>
<l>and Blackfoot of the Spartan: swift as wind</l>
<l>the others followed. Glutton, Quicksight, Surefoot,</l>
<l>three dogs of Arcady; then valiant Killbuck,</l>
<l>Tempest, fierce Hunter, and the rapid Wingfoot;</l>
<l>sharp-scented Chaser, and Woodranger wounded</l>
<l>so lately by a wild boar; savage Wildwood,</l>
<l>the wolf-begot with Shepherdess the cow-dog;</l>
<l>and ravenous Harpy followed by her twin whelps;</l>
<l>and thin-girt Ladon chosen from Sicyonia;</l>
<l>racer and Barker, brindled Spot and Tiger;</l>
<l>sturdy old Stout and white haired Blanche and black Smut</l>
<l>lusty big Lacon, trusty Storm and Quickfoot;</l>
<l>active young Wolfet and her Cyprian brother</l>
<l>black headed Snap, blazed with a patch of white hair</l>
<l>from forehead to his muzzle; swarthy Blackcoat</l>
<l>and shaggy Bristle, Towser and Wildtooth,</l>
<l>his sire of Dicte and his dam of Lacon;</l>
<l>and yelping Babbler: these and others, more</l>
<l>than patience leads us to recount or name.</l>

    
<l>All eager for their prey the pack surmount</l>
<l>rocks, cliffs and crags, precipitous—where paths</l>
<l>are steep, where roads are none. He flies by routes</l>
<l>so oft pursued but now, alas, his flight</l>
<l>is from his own!—He would have cried, “Behold</l>
<l>your master!—It is I—Actaeon!” Words</l>
<l>refused his will. The yelping pack pressed on.</l>
<l>First Blackmane seized and tore his master's back,</l>
<l>Savage the next, then Rover's teeth were clinched</l>
<l>deep in his shoulder.—These, though tardy out,</l>
<l>cut through a by-path and arriving first</l>
<l>clung to their master till the pack came up.</l>

    
<l>The whole pack fastened on their master's flesh</l>
<l>till place was none for others. Groaning he</l>
<l>made frightful sounds that not the human voice</l>
<l>could utter nor the stag; and filled the hills</l>
<l>with dismal moans; and as a suppliant fell</l>
<l>down to the ground upon his trembling knees;</l>
<l>and turned his stricken eyes on his own dogs,</l>
<l>entreating them to spare him from their fangs.</l>

    
<l>But his companions, witless of his plight,</l>
<l>urged on the swift pack with their hunting cries.</l>
<l>They sought Actaeon and they vainly called,</l>
<l>“Actaeon! Hi! Actaeon!” just as though</l>
<l>he was away from them. Each time they called</l>
<l>he turned his head. And when they chided him,</l>
<l>whose indolence denied the joys of sport,</l>
<l>how much he wished an indolent desire</l>
<l>had haply held him from his ravenous pack.</l>
<l>Oh, how much;better 'tis to see the hunt,</l>
<l>and the fierce dogs, than feel their savage deeds!</l>
<l>They gathered round him, and they fixed their snouts</l>
<l>deep in his flesh: tore him to pieces, he</l>
<l>whose features only as a stag appeared.—</l>
<l>'Tis said Diana's fury raged with none</l>
<l>abatement till the torn flesh ceased to live.</l>


Semele.
SEMELE AND JUPITERTHE HOUSE OF CADMUS

<l>Hapless Actaeon's end in various ways</l>
<l>was now regarded; some deplored his doom,</l>
<l>but others praised Diana's chastity;</l>
<l>and all gave many reasons. But the spouse</l>
<l>of Jove, alone remaining silent, gave</l>
<l>nor praise nor blame. Whenever calamity</l>
<l>befell the race of Cadmus she rejoiced,</l>
<l>in secret, for she visited her rage</l>
<l>on all Europa's kindred.</l>

    
<l>Now a fresh</l>
<l>occasion has been added to her grief,</l>
<l>and wild with jealousy of Semele,</l>
<l>her tongue as ever ready to her rage,</l>
<l>lets loose a torrent of abuse;</l>

<l>“Away!</l>
<l>Away with words! Why should I speak of it?</l>
<l>Let me attack her! Let me spoil that jade!</l>
<l>Am I not Juno the supreme of Heaven?</l>
<l>Queen of the flashing scepter? Am I not</l>
<l>sister and wife of Jove omnipotent?</l>
<l>She even wishes to be known by him</l>
<l>a mother of a Deity, a joy</l>
<l>almost denied to me! Great confidence</l>
<l>has she in her great beauty—nevertheless,</l>
<l>I shall so weave the web the bolt of Jove</l>
<l>would fail to save her.—Let the Gods deny</l>
<l>that I am Saturn's daughter, if her shade</l>
<l>descend not stricken to the Stygian wave.”</l>

    
<l>She rose up quickly from her shining throne,</l>
<l>and hidden in a cloud of fiery hue</l>
<l>descended to the home of Semele;</l>
<l>and while encompassed by the cloud, transformed</l>
<l>her whole appearance as to counterfeit</l>
<l>old Beroe, an Epidaurian nurse,</l>
<l>who tended Semele.</l>

    
<l>Her tresses changed</l>
<l>to grey, her smooth skin wrinkled and her step</l>
<l>grown feeble as she moved with trembling limbs;—</l>
<l>her voice was quavering as an ancient dame's,</l>
<l>as Juno, thus disguised, began to talk</l>
<l>to Semele. When presently the name</l>
<l>of Jove was mentioned—artful Juno thus;</l>
<l>(doubtful that Jupiter could be her love)—</l>

<l>“When Jove appears to pledge his love to you,</l>
<l>implore him to assume his majesty</l>
<l>and all his glory, even as he does</l>
<l>in presence of his stately Juno—Yea,</l>
<l>implore him to caress you as a God.”</l>

    
<l>With artful words as these the goddess worked</l>
<l>upon the trusting mind of Semele,</l>
<l>daughter of Cadmus, till she begged of Jove</l>
<l>a boon, that only hastened her sad death;</l>
<l>for Jove not knowing her design replied,</l>
<l>“Whatever thy wish, it shall not be denied,</l>
<l>and that thy heart shall suffer no distrust,</l>
<l>I pledge me by that Deity, the Waves</l>
<l>of the deep Stygian Lake,—oath of the Gods.”</l>
<l>All overjoyed at her misfortune, proud</l>
<l>that she prevailed, and pleased that she secured</l>
<l>of him a promise, that could only cause</l>
<l>her own disaster, Semele addressed</l>
<l>almighty Jove; “Come unto me in all</l>
<l>the splendour of thy glory, as thy might</l>
<l>is shown to Juno, goddess of the skies.”</l>
<l>Fain would he stifle her disastrous tongue;</l>
<l>before he knew her quest the words were said;</l>
<l>and, knowing that his greatest oath was pledged,</l>
<l>he sadly mounted to the lofty skies,</l>
<l>and by his potent nod assembled there</l>
<l>the deep clouds: and the rain began to pour,</l>
<l>and thunder-bolts resounded.</l>

    
<l>But he strove</l>
<l>to mitigate his power, and armed him not</l>
<l>with flames overwhelming as had put to flight</l>
<l>his hundred-handed foe Typhoeus—flames</l>
<l>too dreadful. Other thunder-bolts he took,</l>
<l>forged by the Cyclops of a milder heat,</l>
<l>with which insignia of his majesty,</l>
<l>sad and reluctant, he appeared to her.—</l>
<l>her mortal form could not endure the shock</l>
<l>and she was burned to ashes in his sight.</l>

    
<l>An unformed babe was rescued from her side,</l>
<l>and, nurtured in the thigh of Jupiter,</l>
<l>completed Nature's time until his birth.</l>
<l>Ino, his aunt, in secret nursed the boy</l>
<l>and cradled him. And him Nyseian nymphs</l>
<l>concealed in caves and fed with needful milk.</l>


Tiresias.
TIRESIASBLINDPROPHECIES

<l>While these events according to the laws</l>
<l>of destiny occurred, and while the child,</l>
<l>the twice-born Bacchus, in his cradle lay,</l>
<l>'Tis told that Jupiter, a careless hour,</l>
<l>indulged too freely in the nectar cup;</l>
<l>and having laid aside all weighty cares,</l>
<l>jested with Juno as she idled by.</l>

    
<l>Freely the god began; “Who doubts the truth?</l>
<l>The female's pleasure is a great delight,</l>
<l>much greater than the pleasure of a male.”</l>
<l>Juno denied it; wherefore 'twas agreed</l>
<l>to ask Tiresias to declare the truth,</l>
<l>than whom none knew both male and female joys:</l>
<l>for wandering in a green wood he had seen</l>
<l>two serpents coupling; and he took his staff</l>
<l>and sharply struck them, till they broke and fled.</l>
<l>'Tis marvelous, that instant he became</l>
<l>a woman from a man, and so remained</l>
<l>while seven autumns passed. When eight were told,</l>
<l>again he saw them in their former plight,</l>
<l>and thus he spoke; “Since such a power was wrought,</l>
<l>by one stroke of a staff my sex was changed—</l>
<l>again I strike!” And even as he struck</l>
<l>the same two snakes, his former sex returned;</l>
<l>his manhood was restored.—</l>

    
<l>as both agreed</l>
<l>to choose him umpire of the sportive strife,</l>
<l>he gave decision in support of Jove;</l>
<l>from this the disappointment Juno felt</l>
<l>surpassed all reason, and enraged, decreed</l>
<l>eternal night should seal Tiresias' eyes.—</l>
<l>immortal Deities may never turn</l>
<l>decrees and deeds of other Gods to naught,</l>
<l>but Jove, to recompense his loss of sight,</l>
<l>endowed him with the gift of prophecy.</l>


Narcissus. Echo.
NARCISSUS AND ECHOTHE HOUSE OF CADMUS

<l>Tiresias' fame of prophecy was spread</l>
<l>through all the cities of Aonia,</l>
<l>for his unerring answers unto all</l>
<l>who listened to his words. And first of those</l>
<l>that harkened to his fateful prophecies,</l>
<l>a lovely Nymph, named Liriope, came</l>
<l>with her dear son, who then fifteen, might seem</l>
<l>a man or boy—he who was born to her</l>
<l>upon the green merge of Cephissus' stream—</l>
<l>that mighty River-God whom she declared</l>
<l>the father of her boy.—</l>

    
<l>she questioned him.</l>
<l>Imploring him to tell her if her son,</l>
<l>unequalled for his beauty, whom she called</l>
<l>Narcissus, might attain a ripe old age.</l>
<l>To which the blind seer answered in these words,</l>
<l>“If he but fail to recognize himself,</l>
<l>a long life he may have, beneath the sun,”—</l>
<l>so, frivolous the prophet's words appeared;</l>
<l>and yet the event, the manner of his death,</l>
<l>the strange delusion of his frenzied love, confirmed it.</l>

    
<l>Three times five years so were passed.</l>
<l>Another five-years, and the lad might seem</l>
<l>a young man or a boy. And many a youth,</l>
<l>and many a damsel sought to gain his love;</l>
<l>but such his mood and spirit and his pride,</l>
<l>none gained his favour.</l>

    
<l>Once a noisy Nymph,</l>
<l>(who never held her tongue when others spoke,</l>
<l>who never spoke till others had begun)</l>
<l>mocking Echo, spied him as he drove,</l>
<l>in his delusive nets, some timid stags.—</l>

    
<l>for Echo was a Nymph, in olden time,—</l>
<l>and, more than vapid sound,—possessed a form:</l>
<l>and she was then deprived the use of speech,</l>
<l>except to babble and repeat the words,</l>
<l>once spoken, over and over.</l>

    
<l>Juno confused</l>
<l>her silly tongue, because she often held</l>
<l>that glorious goddess with her endless tales,</l>
<l>till many a hapless Nymph, from Jove's embrace,</l>
<l>had made escape adown a mountain. But</l>
<l>for this, the goddess might have caught them. Thus</l>
<l>the glorious Juno, when she knew her guile;</l>

<l>“Your tongue, so freely wagged at my expense,</l>
<l>shall be of little use; your endless voice,</l>
<l>much shorter than your tongue.” At once the Nymph</l>
<l>was stricken as the goddess had decreed;—</l>
<l>and, ever since, she only mocks the sounds</l>
<l>of others' voices, or, perchance, returns</l>
<l>their final words.</l>

    
<l>One day, when she observed</l>
<l>Narcissus wandering in the pathless woods,</l>
<l>she loved him and she followed him, with soft</l>
<l>and stealthy tread.—The more she followed him</l>
<l>the hotter did she burn, as when the flame</l>
<l>flares upward from the sulphur on the torch.</l>

    
<l>Oh, how she longed to make her passion known!</l>
<l>To plead in soft entreaty! to implore his love!</l>
<l>But now, till others have begun, a mute</l>
<l>of Nature she must be. She cannot choose</l>
<l>but wait the moment when his voice may give</l>
<l>to her an answer.</l>

    
<l>Presently the youth,</l>
<l>by chance divided from his trusted friends,</l>
<l>cries loudly, “Who is here?” and Echo, “Here!”</l>
<l>Replies. Amazed, he casts his eyes around,</l>
<l>and calls with louder voice, “Come here!” “Come here!”</l>
<l>She calls the youth who calls.—He turns to see</l>
<l>who calls him and, beholding naught exclaims,</l>
<l>“Avoid me not!” “Avoid me not!” returns.</l>

    
<l>He tries again, again, and is deceived</l>
<l>by this alternate voice, and calls aloud;</l>
<l>“Oh let us come together!” Echo cries,</l>
<l>“Oh let us come together!” Never sound</l>
<l>seemed sweeter to the Nymph, and from the woods</l>
<l>she hastens in accordance with her words,</l>
<l>and strives to wind her arms around his neck.</l>
<l>He flies from her and as he leaves her says,</l>
<l>“Take off your hands! you shall not fold your arms</l>
<l>around me. Better death than such a one</l>
<l>should ever caress me!” Naught she answers save,</l>
<l>“Caress me!”</l>

    
<l>Thus rejected she lies hid</l>
<l>in the deep woods, hiding her blushing face</l>
<l>with the green leaves; and ever after lives</l>
<l>concealed in lonely caverns in the hills.</l>

    
<l>But her great love increases with neglect;</l>
<l>her miserable body wastes away,</l>
<l>wakeful with sorrows; leanness shrivels up</l>
<l>her skin, and all her lovely features melt,</l>
<l>as if dissolved upon the wafting winds—</l>
<l>nothing remains except her bones and voice—</l>
<l>her voice continues, in the wilderness;</l>
<l>her bones have turned to stone. She lies concealed</l>
<l>in the wild woods, nor is she ever seen</l>
<l>on lonely mountain range; for, though we hear</l>
<l>her calling in the hills, 'tis but a voice,</l>
<l>a voice that lives, that lives among the hills.</l>

    
<l>Thus he deceived the Nymph and many more,</l>
<l>sprung from the mountains or the sparkling waves;</l>
<l>and thus he slighted many an amorous youth.—</l>
<l>and therefore, some one whom he once despised,</l>
<l>lifting his hands to Heaven, implored the Gods,</l>
<l>“If he should love deny him what he loves!”</l>
<l>and as the prayer was uttered it was heard</l>
<l>by Nemesis, who granted her assent.</l>

NARCISSUS

<l>There was a fountain silver-clear and bright,</l>
<l>which neither shepherds nor the wild she-goats,</l>
<l>that range the hills, nor any cattle's mouth</l>
<l>had touched—its waters were unsullied—birds</l>
<l>disturbed it not; nor animals, nor boughs</l>
<l>that fall so often from the trees. Around</l>
<l>sweet grasses nourished by the stream grew; trees</l>
<l>that shaded from the sun let balmy airs</l>
<l>temper its waters. Here Narcissus, tired</l>
<l>of hunting and the heated noon, lay down,</l>
<l>attracted by the peaceful solitudes</l>
<l>and by the glassy spring. There as he stooped</l>
<l>to quench his thirst another thirst increased.</l>

    
<l>While he is drinking he beholds himself</l>
<l>reflected in the mirrored pool—and loves;</l>
<l>loves an imagined body which contains</l>
<l>no substance, for he deems the mirrored shade</l>
<l>a thing of life to love. He cannot move,</l>
<l>for so he marvels at himself, and lies</l>
<l>with countenance unchanged, as if indeed</l>
<l>a statue carved of Parian marble. Long,</l>
<l>supine upon the bank, his gaze is fixed</l>
<l>on his own eyes, twin stars; his fingers shaped</l>
<l>as Bacchus might desire, his flowing hair</l>
<l>as glorious as Apollo's, and his cheeks</l>
<l>youthful and smooth; his ivory neck, his mouth</l>
<l>dreaming in sweetness, his complexion fair</l>
<l>and blushing as the rose in snow-drift white.</l>
<l>All that is lovely in himself he loves,</l>
<l>and in his witless way he wants himself:—</l>
<l>he who approves is equally approved;</l>
<l>he seeks, is sought, he burns and he is burnt.</l>

    
<l>And how he kisses the deceitful fount;</l>
<l>and how he thrusts his arms to catch the neck</l>
<l>that's pictured in the middle of the stream!</l>
<l>Yet never may he wreathe his arms around</l>
<l>that image of himself. He knows not what</l>
<l>he there beholds, but what he sees inflames</l>
<l>his longing, and the error that deceives</l>
<l>allures his eyes. But why, O foolish boy,</l>
<l>so vainly catching at this flitting form?</l>
<l>The cheat that you are seeking has no place.</l>
<l>Avert your gaze and you will lose your love,</l>
<l>for this that holds your eyes is nothing save</l>
<l>the image of yourself reflected back to you.</l>
<l>It comes and waits with you; it has no life;</l>
<l>it will depart if you will only go.</l>


    
<l>Nor food nor rest can draw him thence—outstretched</l>
<l>upon the overshadowed green, his eyes</l>
<l>fixed on the mirrored image never may know</l>
<l>their longings satisfied, and by their sight</l>
<l>he is himself undone. Raising himself</l>
<l>a moment, he extends his arms around,</l>
<l>and, beckoning to the murmuring forest; “Oh,</l>
<l>ye aisled wood was ever man in love</l>
<l>more fatally than I? Your silent paths</l>
<l>have sheltered many a one whose love was told,</l>
<l>and ye have heard their voices. Ages vast</l>
<l>have rolled away since your forgotten birth,</l>
<l>but who is he through all those weary years</l>
<l>that ever pined away as I? Alas,</l>
<l>this fatal image wins my love, as I</l>
<l>behold it. But I cannot press my arms</l>
<l>around the form I see, the form that gives</l>
<l>me joy. What strange mistake has intervened</l>
<l>betwixt us and our love? It grieves me more</l>
<l>that neither lands nor seas nor mountains, no,</l>
<l>nor walls with closed gates deny our loves,</l>
<l>but only a little water keeps us far</l>
<l>asunder. Surely he desires my love</l>
<l>and my embraces, for as oft I strive</l>
<l>to kiss him, bending to the limpid stream</l>
<l>my lips, so often does he hold his face</l>
<l>fondly to me, and vainly struggles up.</l>
<l>It seems that I could touch him. 'Tis a strange</l>
<l>delusion that is keeping us apart.</l>

<l>“Whoever thou art, Come up! Deceive me not!</l>
<l>Oh, whither when I fain pursue art thou?</l>
<l>Ah, surely I am young and fair, the Nymphs</l>
<l>have loved me; and when I behold thy smiles</l>
<l>I cannot tell thee what sweet hopes arise.</l>
<l>When I extend my loving arms to thee</l>
<l>thine also are extended me — thy smiles</l>
<l>return my own. When I was weeping, I</l>
<l>have seen thy tears, and every sign I make</l>
<l>thou cost return; and often thy sweet lips</l>
<l>have seemed to move, that, peradventure words,</l>
<l>which I have never heard, thou hast returned.</l>

<l>“No more my shade deceives me, I perceive</l>
<l>'Tis I in thee—I love myself—the flame</l>
<l>arises in my breast and burns my heart—</l>
<l>what shall I do? Shall I at once implore?</l>
<l>Or should I linger till my love is sought?</l>
<l>What is it I implore? The thing that I</l>
<l>desire is mine—abundance makes me poor.</l>
<l>Oh, I am tortured by a strange desire</l>
<l>unknown to me before, for I would fain</l>
<l>put off this mortal form; which only means</l>
<l>I wish the object of my love away.</l>
<l>Grief saps my strength, the sands of life are run,</l>
<l>and in my early youth am I cut off;</l>
<l>but death is not my bane—it ends my woe.—</l>
<l>I would not death for this that is my love,</l>
<l>as two united in a single soul</l>
<l>would die as one.”</l>

    
<l>He spoke; and crazed with love,</l>
<l>returned to view the same face in the pool;</l>
<l>and as he grieved his tears disturbed the stream,</l>
<l>and ripples on the surface, glassy clear,</l>
<l>defaced his mirrored form. And thus the youth,</l>
<l>when he beheld that lovely shadow go;</l>
<l>“Ah whither cost thou fly? Oh, I entreat</l>
<l>thee leave me not. Alas, thou cruel boy</l>
<l>thus to forsake thy lover. Stay with me</l>
<l>that I may see thy lovely form, for though</l>
<l>I may not touch thee I shall feed my eyes</l>
<l>and soothe my wretched pains.” And while he spoke</l>
<l>he rent his garment from the upper edge,</l>
<l>and beating on his naked breast, all white</l>
<l>as marble, every stroke produced a tint</l>
<l>as lovely as the apple streaked with red,</l>
<l>or as the glowing grape when purple bloom</l>
<l>touches the ripening clusters.</l>

    
<l>When as glass</l>
<l>again the rippling waters smoothed, and when</l>
<l>such beauty in the stream the youth observed,</l>
<l>no more could he endure. As in the flame</l>
<l>the yellow wax, or as the hoar-frost melts</l>
<l>in early morning 'neath the genial sun;</l>
<l>so did he pine away, by love consumed,</l>
<l>and slowly wasted by a hidden flame.</l>
<l>No vermeil bloom now mingled in the white</l>
<l>of his complexion fair; no strength has he,</l>
<l>no vigor, nor the comeliness that wrought</l>
<l>for love so long: alas, that handsome form</l>
<l>by Echo fondly loved may please no more.</l>

    
<l>But when she saw him in his hapless plight,</l>
<l>though angry at his scorn, she only grieved.</l>
<l>As often as the love-lore boy complained,</l>
<l>“Alas!” “Alas!” her echoing voice returned;</l>
<l>and as he struck his hands against his arms,</l>
<l>she ever answered with her echoing sounds.</l>
<l>And as he gazed upon the mirrored pool</l>
<l>he said at last, “Ah, youth beloved in vain!”</l>
<l>“In vain, in vain!” the spot returned his words;</l>
<l>and when he breathed a sad “farewell!” “Farewell!”</l>
<l>sighed Echo too. He laid his wearied head,</l>
<l>and rested on the verdant grass; and those</l>
<l>bright eyes, which had so loved to gaze, entranced,</l>
<l>on their own master's beauty, sad Night closed.</l>
<l>And now although among the nether shades</l>
<l>his sad sprite roams, he ever loves to gaze</l>
<l>on his reflection in the Stygian wave.</l>

    
<l>His Naiad sisters mourned, and having clipped</l>
<l>their shining tresses laid them on his corpse:</l>
<l>and all the Dryads mourned: and Echo made</l>
<l>lament anew. And these would have upraised</l>
<l>his funeral pyre, and waved the flaming torch,</l>
<l>and made his bier; but as they turned their eyes</l>
<l>where he had been, alas he was not there!</l>
<l>And in his body's place a sweet flower grew,</l>
<l>golden and white, the white around the gold.</l>


Pentheus.
PENTHEUS AND BACCHUS

<l>Narcissus' fate, when known throughout the land</l>
<l>and cities of Achaia, added fame</l>
<l>deserved, to blind Tiresias,—mighty seer.</l>
<l>Yet Pentheus, bold despiser of the Gods,</l>
<l>son of Echion, scoffed at all his praise,</l>
<l>and, sole of man deriding the great seer,</l>
<l>upbraided him his hapless loss of sight.</l>

    
<l>And shaking his white temples, hoar with age.</l>
<l>Tiresias of Pentheus prophesied,</l>
<l>“Oh glad the day to thee, if, light denied,</l>
<l>thine eyes, most fortunate, should not behold</l>
<l>the Bacchanalian rites! The day will come,</l>
<l>and soon the light will dawn, when Bacchus, born</l>
<l>of Semele, shall make his advent known—</l>
<l>all hail the new god Bacchus! Either thou</l>
<l>must build a temple to this Deity,</l>
<l>or shalt be torn asunder; thy remains,</l>
<l>throughout the forest scattered, will pollute</l>
<l>the wood with sanguinary streams; and thy</l>
<l>life-blood bespatter with corrupting blots</l>
<l>thy frenzied mother and her sisters twain.</l>
<l>And all shall come to pass, as I have told,</l>
<l>because thou wilt not honour the New God.</l>
<l>And thou shalt wail and marvel at the sight</l>
<l>of blind Tiresias, though veiled in night.”</l>

    
<l>And as he spoke, lo, Pentheus drove the seer:</l>
<l>but all his words, prophetic, were fulfilled,</l>
<l>and confirmation followed in his steps.—</l>

    
<l>Bacchus at once appears, and all the fields</l>
<l>resound with shouts of everybody there.—</l>
<l>men, brides and matrons, and a howling rout—</l>
<l>nobles and commons and the most refined—</l>
<l>a motley multitude—resistless borne</l>
<l>to join those rites of Bacchus, there begun.</l>

    
<l>Then Pentheus cries; “What madness, O ye brave</l>
<l>descendants of the Dragon! Sons of Mars!</l>
<l>What frenzy has confounded you? Can sounds</l>
<l>of clanging brass prevail; and pipes and horns,</l>
<l>and magical delusions, drunkenness,</l>
<l>and yelling women, and obscene displays,</l>
<l>and hollow drums, overcome you, whom the sword,</l>
<l>nor troops of war, nor trumpet could affright?</l>

<l>“How shall I wonder at these ancient men,</l>
<l>who, crossing boundless seas from distant Tyre,</l>
<l>hither transferred their exiled Household Gods,</l>
<l>and founded a new Tyre; but now are shorn,</l>
<l>and even as captives would be led away</l>
<l>without appeal to Mars? And, O young men,</l>
<l>of active prime whose vigor equals mine!</l>
<l>Cast down your ivy scepters; take up arms;</l>
<l>put on your helmets; strip your brows of leaves;</l>
<l>be mindful of the mighty stock you are,</l>
<l>and let your souls be animated with</l>
<l>the spirit of that dauntless dragon, which,</l>
<l>unaided, slew so many, and at last</l>
<l>died to defend his fountain and his lake.—</l>
<l>so ye may conquer in the hope of fame.</l>

<l>“He gave the brave to death, but with your arms</l>
<l>ye shall expel the worthless, and enhance</l>
<l>the glory of your land. If Fate decree</l>
<l>the fall of Thebes, Oh, let the engines</l>
<l>of war and men pull down its walls, and let</l>
<l>the clash of steel and roaring flames resound.</l>
<l>Thus, blameless in great misery, our woes</l>
<l>would be the theme of lamentations, known</l>
<l>to story; and our tears would shame us not.</l>

<l>“But now an unarmed boy will conquer Thebes:</l>
<l>a lad whom neither weapons, wars nor steeds</l>
<l>delight; whose ringlets reek with myrrh; adorned</l>
<l>with chaplets, purple and embroidered robes</l>
<l>of interwoven gold. Make way for me!</l>
<l>And I will soon compel him to confess</l>
<l>his father is assumed and all his rites</l>
<l>are frauds.</l>

<l>“If in days gone Acrisius</l>
<l>so held this vain god in deserved contempt,</l>
<l>and shut the Argive gates against his face,</l>
<l>why, therefore, should not Pentheus close the gates</l>
<l>of Thebes, with equal courage—Hence! Away!</l>
<l>Fetch the vile leader of these rioters</l>
<l>in chains! Let not my mandate be delayed.”</l>

    
<l>Him to restrain his grandsire, Cadmus, strove;</l>
<l>and Athamas, and many of his trusted friends</l>
<l>united in vain efforts to rebuke</l>
<l>his reckless rage; but greater violence</l>
<l>was gained from every admonition.—</l>
<l>his rage increased the more it was restrained,</l>
<l>and injury resulted from his friends.</l>
<l>So have I seen a stream in open course,</l>
<l>run gently on its way with pleasant noise,</l>
<l>but whensoever logs and rocks detained,</l>
<l>it foamed, with violence increased, against</l>
<l>obstruction.</l>

    
<l>Presently returning came</l>
<l>his servants stained with blood, to whom he said,</l>
<l>“What have ye done with Bacchus?” And to him</l>
<l>they made reply; “Not Bacchus have we seen,</l>
<l>but we have taken his attendant lad,</l>
<l>the chosen servant of his sacred rites.”</l>
<l>And they delivered to the noble king,</l>
<l>a youth whose hands were lashed behind his back.</l>

    
<l>Then Pentheus, terrible in anger, turned</l>
<l>his awful gaze upon the lad, and though</l>
<l>he scarce deferred his doom, addressed him thus;</l>
<l>“Doomed to destruction, thou art soon to give</l>
<l>example to my people by thy death:</l>
<l>tell me thy name; what are thy parents called;</l>
<l>where is thy land; and wherefore art thou found</l>
<l>attendant on these Bacchanalian rites.”</l>


    
<l>But fearless he replied; “They call my name</l>
<l>Acoetes; and Maeonia is the land</l>
<l>from whence I came. My parents were so poor,</l>
<l>my father left me neither fruitful fields,</l>
<l>tilled by the lusty ox, nor fleecy sheep,</l>
<l>nor lowing kine; for, he himself was poor,</l>
<l>and with his hook and line was wont to catch</l>
<l>the leaping fishes, landed by his rod.</l>
<l>His skill was all his wealth. And when to me</l>
<l>he gave his trade, he said, ‘You are the heir</l>
<l>of my employment, therefore unto you</l>
<l>all that is mine I give,’ and, at his death,</l>
<l>he left me nothing but the running waves. —</l>
<l>they are the sum of my inheritance.</l>

<l>“And, afterwhile, that I might not be bound</l>
<l>forever to my father's rocky shores,</l>
<l>I learned to steer the keel with dextrous hand;</l>
<l>and marked with watchful gaze the guiding stars;</l>
<l>the watery Constellation of the Goat,</l>
<l>Olenian, and the Bear, the Hyades,</l>
<l>the Pleiades, the houses of the winds,</l>
<l>and every harbour suitable for ships.</l>

<l>“So chanced it, as I made for Delos, first</l>
<l>I veered close to the shores of Chios: there</l>
<l>I steered, by plying on the starboard oar,</l>
<l>and nimbly leaping gained the sea-wet strand.</l>

<l>“Now when the night was past and lovely dawn</l>
<l>appeared, I,rose from slumber, and I bade</l>
<l>my men to fetch fresh water, and I showed</l>
<l>the pathway to the stream. Then did I climb</l>
<l>a promontory's height, to learn from there</l>
<l>the promise of the winds; which having done,</l>
<l>I called the men and sought once more my ship.</l>
<l>Opheltes, first of my companions, cried,</l>
<l>‘Behold we come!’ And, thinking he had caught</l>
<l>a worthy prize in that unfruitful land,</l>
<l>he led a boy, of virgin-beauty formed,</l>
<l>across the shore.</l>

<l>“Heavy with wine and sleep</l>
<l>the lad appeared to stagger on his way,—</l>
<l>with difficulty moving. When I saw</l>
<l>the manner of his dress, his countenance</l>
<l>and grace, I knew it was not mortal man,</l>
<l>and being well assured, I said to them;</l>
<l>‘What Deity abideth in that form</l>
<l>I cannot say; but 'tis a god in truth.—</l>
<l>O whosoever thou art, vouchsafe to us</l>
<l>propitious waters; ease our toils, and grant</l>
<l>to these thy grace.’</l>

<l>“At this, the one of all</l>
<l>my mariners who was the quickest hand,</l>
<l>who ever was the nimblest on the yards,</l>
<l>and first to slip the ropes, Dictys exclaimed;</l>
<l>‘Pray not for us!’ and all approved his words.</l>
<l>The golden haired, the guardian of the prow,</l>
<l>Melanthus, Libys and Alcimedon</l>
<l>approved it; and Epopeus who should urge</l>
<l>the flagging spirits, and with rhythmic chants</l>
<l>give time and measure to the beating oars,</l>
<l>and all the others praised their leader's words,—</l>
<l>so blind is greed of gain.—Then I rejoined,</l>
<l>‘Mine is the greatest share in this good ship,</l>
<l>which I will not permit to be destroyed,</l>
<l>nor injured by this sacred freight:’ and I</l>
<l>opposed them as they came.</l>

<l>“Then Lycabas,</l>
<l>the most audacious of that impious crew,</l>
<l>began to rage. He was a criminal,</l>
<l>who, for a dreadful murder, had been sent</l>
<l>in exile from a Tuscan city's gates.</l>
<l>Whilst I opposed he gripped me by the throat,</l>
<l>and shook me as would cast me in the deep,</l>
<l>had I not firmly held a rope, half stunned:</l>
<l>and all that wicked crew approved the deed.</l>

<l>“Then Bacchus (be assured it was the God)</l>
<l>as though the noise disturbed his lethargy</l>
<l>from wine, and reason had regained its power,</l>
<l>at last bespake the men, ‘What deeds are these?</l>
<l>What noise assails my ears? What means decoyed</l>
<l>my wandering footsteps? Whither do ye lead?’</l>
<l>‘Fear not,’ the steersman said, ‘but tell us fair</l>
<l>the haven of your hope, and you shall land</l>
<l>whereso your heart desires.’ ‘To Naxos steer,’</l>
<l>Quoth Bacchus, ‘for it is indeed my home,</l>
<l>and there the mariner finds welcome cheer.’</l>
<l>Him to deceive, they pledged themselves, and swore</l>
<l>by Gods of seas and skies to do his will:</l>
<l>and they commanded me to steer that way.</l>

<l>“The Isle of Naxos was upon our right;</l>
<l>and when they saw the sails were set that way,</l>
<l>they all began to shout at once, ‘What, ho!</l>
<l>Thou madman! what insanity is this,</l>
<l>Acoetes? Make our passage to the left.’</l>
<l>And all the while they made their meaning known</l>
<l>by artful signs or whispers in my ears.</l>

<l>“I was amazed and answered, ‘Take the helm.’</l>
<l>And I refused to execute their will,</l>
<l>atrocious, and at once resigned command.</l>
<l>Then all began to murmur, and the crew</l>
<l>reviled me. Up Aethalion jumped and said,</l>
<l>‘As if our only safety is in you!’</l>
<l>With this he swaggered up and took command;</l>
<l>and leaving Naxos steered for other shores.</l>

<l>“Then Bacchus, mocking them,—as if but then</l>
<l>he had discovered their deceitful ways,—</l>
<l>looked on the ocean from the rounded stern,</l>
<l>and seemed to sob as he addressed the men;</l>
<l>‘Ah mariners, what alien shores are these?</l>
<l>'Tis not the land you promised nor the port</l>
<l>my heart desires. For what have I deserved</l>
<l>this cruel wrong? What honour can accrue</l>
<l>if strong men mock a boy; a lonely youth</l>
<l>if many should deceive?’ And as he spoke,</l>
<l>I, also, wept to see their wickedness.</l>

<l>“The impious gang made merry at our tears,</l>
<l>and lashed the billows with their quickening oars.</l>
<l>By Bacchus do I swear to you (and naught</l>
<l>celestial is more potent) all the things</l>
<l>I tell you are as true as they surpass</l>
<l>the limit of belief. The ship stood still</l>
<l>as if a dry dock held it in the sea.—</l>

<l>“The wondering sailors laboured at the oars,</l>
<l>and they unfurled the sails, in hopes to gain</l>
<l>some headway, with redoubled energies;</l>
<l>but twisting ivy tangled in the oars,</l>
<l>and interlacing held them by its weight.</l>
<l>And Bacchus in the midst of all stood crowned</l>
<l>with chaplets of grape-leaves, and shook a lance</l>
<l>covered with twisted fronds of leafy vines.</l>
<l>Around him crouched the visionary forms</l>
<l>of tigers, lynxes, and the mottled shapes</l>
<l>of panthers.</l>

<l>“Then the mariners leaped out,</l>
<l>possessed by fear or madness. Medon first</l>
<l>began to turn a swarthy hue, and fins</l>
<l>grew outward from his flattened trunk,</l>
<l>and with a curving spine his body bent.—</l>
<l>then Lycabas to him, ‘What prodigy</l>
<l>is this that I behold?’ Even as he spoke,</l>
<l>his jaws were broadened and his nose was bent;</l>
<l>his hardened skin was covered with bright scales.</l>
<l>And Libys, as he tried to pull the oars,</l>
<l>could see his own hands shrivel into fins;</l>
<l>another of the crew began to grasp</l>
<l>the twisted ropes, but even as he strove</l>
<l>to lift his arms they fastened to his sides;—</l>
<l>with bending body and a crooked back</l>
<l>he plunged into the waves, and as he swam</l>
<l>displayed a tail, as crescent as the moon.</l>

<l>“Now here, now there, they flounce about the ship;</l>
<l>they spray her decks with brine; they rise and sink;</l>
<l>they rise again, and dive beneath the waves;</l>
<l>they seem in sportive dance upon the main;</l>
<l>out from their nostrils they spout sprays of brine;</l>
<l>they toss their supple sides. And I alone,</l>
<l>of twenty mariners that manned that ship,</l>
<l>remained. A cold chill seized my limbs,—</l>
<l>I was so frightened; but the gracious God</l>
<l>now spake me fair, ‘Fear not and steer for Naxos.’</l>
<l>And when we landed there I ministered</l>
<l>on smoking altars Bacchanalian rites.”</l>


    
<l>But Pentheus answered him: “A parlous tale,</l>
<l>and we have listened to the dreary end,</l>
<l>hoping our anger might consume its rage;—</l>
<l>away with him! hence drag him, hurl him out,</l>
<l>with dreadful torture, into Stygian night.”</l>

    
<l>Quickly they seized and dragged Acoetes forth,</l>
<l>and cast him in a dungeon triple-strong.</l>
<l>And while they fixed the instruments of death,</l>
<l>kindled the fires, and wrought the cruel irons,</l>
<l>the legend says, though no one aided him,</l>
<l>the chains were loosened and slipped off his arms;</l>
<l>the doors flew open of their own accord.</l>

    
<l>But Pentheus, long-persisting in his rage,</l>
<l>not caring to command his men to go,</l>
<l>himself went forth to Mount Cithaeron, where</l>
<l>resound with singing and with shrilly note</l>
<l>the votaries of Bacchus at their rites.</l>
<l>As when with sounding brass the trumpeter</l>
<l>alarms of war, the mettled charger neighs</l>
<l>and scents the battle; so the clamored skies</l>
<l>resounding with the dreadful outcries fret</l>
<l>the wrath of Pentheus and his rage enflame.</l>

    
<l>About the middle of the mount (with groves</l>
<l>around its margin) was a treeless plain,</l>
<l>where nothing might conceal. Here as he stood</l>
<l>to view the sacred rites with impious eyes,</l>
<l>his mother saw him first. She was so wrought</l>
<l>with frenzy that she failed to know her son,</l>
<l>and cast her thyrsus that it wounded him;</l>
<l>and shouted, “Hi! come hither, Ho!</l>
<l>Come hither my two sisters! a great boar</l>
<l>hath strayed into our fields; come! see me strike</l>
<l>and wound him!”</l>

    
<l>As he fled from them in fright</l>
<l>the raging multitude rushed after him;</l>
<l>and, as they gathered round; in cowardice</l>
<l>he cried for mercy and condemned himself,</l>
<l>confessing he had sinned against a God.</l>
<l>And as they wounded him he called his aunt;</l>
<l>“Autonoe have mercy! Let the shade</l>
<l>of sad Actaeon move thee to relent!”</l>
<l>No pity moved her when she heard that name;</l>
<l>in a wild frenzy she forgot her son.</l>
<l>While Pentheus was imploring her, she tore</l>
<l>his right arm out; her sister Ino wrenched</l>
<l>the other from his trunk. He could not stretch</l>
<l>his arms out to his mother, but he cried,</l>
<l>“Behold me, mother!” When Agave saw,</l>
<l>his bleeding limbs, torn, scattered on the ground,</l>
<l>she howled, and tossed her head, and shook her hair</l>
<l>that streamed upon the breeze; and when his head</l>
<l>was wrenched out from his mangled corpse,</l>
<l>she clutched it with her blood-smeared fingers, while</l>
<l>she shouted, “Ho! companions! victory!</l>
<l>The victory is ours!” So when the wind</l>
<l>strips from a lofty tree its leaves, which touched</l>
<l>by autumn's cold are loosely held, they fall</l>
<l>not quicker than the wretch's bleeding limbs</l>
<l>were torn asunder by their cursed hands.</l>

    
<l>Now, frightened by this terrible event,</l>
<l>the women of Ismenus celebrate</l>
<l>the new Bacchantian rites; and they revere</l>
<l>the sacred altars, heaped with frankincense.</l>
